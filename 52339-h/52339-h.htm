<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>In publishing this work few prefatory remarks are
required, beyond an explanation of the circumstances
which led to its assuming the present form. The
primary object contemplated was to place before
general readers a record of some remarkable discoveries
recently made in the south-west of Scotland,
in a department of Archæology hitherto little known,
and of which carefully prepared reports have already
appeared in the second and third volumes of the
Collections of the Ayrshire and Wigtownshire
Archæological Association.</p>

<p>As it was at the instigation of R. W. Cochran-Patrick,
Esq., M.P., that the explorations which led
to these discoveries were originally undertaken, so it
was also with him that the proposal to issue these
reports in a handy volume originated. It occurred,
however, to me, that, considering how little had been
known of Scottish Lake-Dwellings in general, and
that even this little was only accessible to the mem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>bers
of a few learned Societies, it would be a more
satisfactory undertaking to incorporate with the
original reports, a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">résumé</i> of the observations made
by previous writers and explorers, so as to present to
the public a complete compendium, as it were, of the
whole subject.</p>

<p>The outcome of this idea is the volume now published,
which, accordingly, aims at comprising all that
is actually known of ancient <em>British</em> Lake-Dwellings
up to the present time.</p>

<p>Such being its comprehensive scope, perhaps an
apology ought to be here made for its many shortcomings;
but this, I trust, will appear less necessary
when I explain that it is the result of the occupation
of such scraps of time as could be spared during the
last two or three years from the active duties of a
busy professional life.</p>

<p>Instead of attempting to interpret the references
made to Lake-Dwellings by previous writers (many
of which, though correct in point of fact, were little
understood by the observers), in virtue of the additional
knowledge derived from recent explorations,
and giving the substance of their observations in my
own language, I have thought it preferable to retain
the exact words of the original narrators. Hence my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
principal work, in the compilation of Chapter ii., was
the selection from a mass of literature&mdash;chiefly old&mdash;of
such portions as could be fairly construed to indicate
the former existence of ancient lacustrine abodes in
this country. The brevity of this portion of the work
can be easily remedied by a perusal of the original
sources from which my extracts have been taken, to
all of which I have been careful in supplying the
proper references.</p>

<p>The great services rendered to the science of
Archæology by the numerous gentlemen who interested
themselves in the various crannogs, and helped to
bring the explorations to a successful termination, are
faithfully acknowledged in the text where the respective
investigations are described.</p>

<p>To R. W. Cochran-Patrick, Esq., LL.D., F.S.A., M.P.,
I am under the deepest obligations for valuable advice
and assistance received in all stages of the researches&mdash;explorations,
engravings, reports, etc.,&mdash;all being
subject to his critical supervision. For the knowledge
which he thus so freely and unselfishly placed at my
disposal, as well as for much encouragement kindly
given during the progress of the entire work, I now
beg to express my warmest thanks.</p>

<p>To Joseph Anderson, Esq., LL.D., Keeper of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
National Museum of the Antiquaries of Scotland, I
am indebted for many hints regarding the character
of the relics, and for his kindness in reading the proof-sheets
of Chapter v. The remarks made in this
chapter on the historical and traditional phenomena
associated with the Lake-Dwelling area in Scotland,
and on the supposed climatal changes since the prehistoric
period, are intended as mere side-lights, and
for the benefit of general readers who may be curious
to know what (<em>i.e.</em> how little) the collateral sciences
have to do with the special branch of Archæology
treated of in this volume.</p>

<p>I have also to express my indebtedness to the
Ayrshire and Wigtownshire Archæological Association
for the use of all the woodcuts illustrating Chapters
iii. and iv., with the exception of Figs. 33 to 35, and
38 to 42, Fig. 54, Fig. 138, and Figs. 159 to 161;
and for permission to reprint the article of the late
Professor Rolleston on the Osseous Remains from the
Lochlee Crannog; that of Professor Bayley Balfour
on the Vegetal Remains from the same Crannog;
that of Mr. John Borland, F.C.S., F.R.M.S., on the
Analysis of Vivianite; that of Professor Cleland,
F.R.S., on the Osseous Remains from the Buston
Crannog; that of John Evans, Esq., D.C.L., F.R.S.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
F.S.A., on the Saxon Coin; and that of the Rev.
George Wilson, C.M.S.A. Scot., on the investigation
of Barhapple Crannog.</p>

<p>I am under similar obligations to the Society of
Antiquaries of Scotland for the use of many of the
woodcuts illustrating Chapter ii.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="p3a">INTRODUCTORY.</p>


<p>In searching back through the successive stages of human
civilisation we arrive at a period when both written history
and traditions fail. This prehistoric period, up to the commencement
of the present century, was entirely lost in the
thick veil of darkness which surrounded everything pertaining
to the past history of the globe. As, however,
the truths of geology became gradually formulated into a
science, and men's minds got accustomed to apply the new
methods of research to the elucidation of the origin and
history of the human race, the sphere of prehistoric archæology
became equally well defined. The group of phenomena
with which it attempts to grapple occupies a sort of neutral
territory or borderland between geology and history proper,
from both of which, however, it receives large nutrient
offshoots. The essential element which characterises the
science of prehistoric archæology is an inductive process
which depends on the clearness and precision with which
the most primitive remains of human art and industries can
be identified. But these remains, of whatever materials
they may be composed, are liable to the destructive influences
of time, and, sooner or later, they become obliterated
by disintegration or decomposition. Few compound substances,
even in the inorganic kingdom, resist this law, and
as for the elaborate productions of the organic kingdom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
such as plants and animals, they are hardly ushered into
being when a counter process of decay begins, which ends
in reducing them to their simple constituents, so that, in a
short time, not a trace of their former existence remains. In
the midst of these ever-changing activities of life and death
which modern scientists have irrefutably shown to have been
continuously and progressively at work for countless ages,
it may be fairly asked&mdash;What is the nature of the evidence
by which antiquaries have so largely extended their field of
inquiry and propounded such startling opinions regarding
the origin and antiquity of our race? In their case the
evidence is due to exceptional circumstances which tend to
counteract or retard the gnawing tooth of time, and cheat, as
it were, Dame Nature out of her ordinary results. Thus, if
the handicraft products of reasoning man, or perishable
organisms, such as the bodies of animals, be accidentally
deposited in the mud of a sea, lake, or river, or suddenly
buried in the ruins of a city, or sunk in a bed of growing peat,
or become frozen up in a field of perpetual ice, these exceptional
results are apt to follow. Hence, an object may be
preserved for centuries after its congeners, in ordinary circumstances,
have crumbled into dust; or, if ultimately it
should become decomposed, a cast or mould may have been
previously formed by means of which, ages afterwards, an
intelligent observer will be enabled to determine its distinguishing
characteristics. In arctic regions the carcasses of
animals known to have been extinct for hundreds of years
have been found imbedded in ice and so thoroughly preserved
that their flesh was actually consumed by the dogs
of the present day; and it is not a rare occurrence to find in
mossy bogs, such as those in Ireland, the bodies of human
beings, that have become accidentally buried in them centuries
ago, completely mummified by the preservative influence
of the matrix in which they have been entombed. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
short, these preservative qualities in nature are analogous to
our artificial processes of pickling, embalming, or refrigerating,
and had it not been for their occasional occurrence naturally,
neither the science of geology nor that of prehistoric
archæology would have much chance of being called into
existence; nor could we now have any knowledge of the
consecutive series of animals and plants that have inhabited
this globe prior to the few centuries to which our historical
records extend.</p>

<p>That these facts have failed to draw attention to lacustrine
and other alluvial deposits as rich repositories of the remains
of prehistoric man in Europe till about a quarter of a century
ago, is more remarkable when we consider that ancient
authors are not altogether silent on the habit prevailing
among some races of erecting wooden abodes in lakes and
marshes; that the Swiss lake villages, though singularly
enough unnoticed by historians, were occupied as late as the
Roman period; that frequent references have been made in
the Irish annals to the stockaded islands, or as they are here
called Crannoges, as existing in Ireland down to the Middle
Ages; and that a similar custom is now found to be prevalent
amongst some of the ruder races of mankind in
various parts of the globe.</p>

<p>Hippocrates (<cite>De Aeribus</cite>, xxxvii.) speaks of the people in
the Phasis, who live in the marshes, and have houses of
timber and reeds constructed in the midst of the waters, to
which they sail in single tree canoes. Herodotus (v. 16)
also describes the dwellers upon the lake Prasias, whose
huts were placed on platforms supported by tall piles in the
midst of the lake, with a narrow bridge as an approach, and
who, on one occasion, successfully resisted the military
resources of a Persian army.</p>

<p>Villages composed of pile-dwellings are numerous along
the shores of the Gulf of Maracaibo. "The positions chosen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
for their erections are near the mouths of rivers and in
shallow waters. The piles on which they rest are driven
deep into the oozy bottom, and so firmly do they hold that
there is no shakiness of the loftily-perched dwelling perceptible,
even when crowded with people.... Similar
dwellings are found in other parts of South America, about
the mouths of the Orinoco and the Amazons. They are
the invention, not exactly of savages, but of tribes of men
in a very primitive stage of culture."&mdash;(<cite>Illustrated Travels</cite>,
vol. ii. pp. 19-21.)</p>

<p>Captain Cameron describes three villages built on piles
in Lake Mohrya in Central Africa, and in his book of
travels gives two sketches of these interesting abodes.&mdash;(<cite>Across
Africa</cite>, vol. ii. p. 63.)</p>

<p>Captain R. F. Burton&mdash;"Notes connected with Dahoman"&mdash;refers
to a tribe called Iso, who "have built their huts
upon tall poles about a mile distant from the shore."&mdash;(<cite>Memoirs
of the Anthropological Society</cite>, vol. i. p. 311.)</p>

<p>Pile-dwellings have been observed along the coasts of
New Guinea and Borneo and the creeks and harbours running
into the Straits of Malacca. In looking over some
photographs recently brought from these regions, I was
struck with one which is a representation of lake-dwellings
at Singapore. The houses appear to be erected on a series
of tall piles, and between the flooring and the water there is
a considerable space in which the boats are hung up.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Though a few incidental notices of ancient lake-dwellings
in Scotland preceded, in point of time, analogous discoveries
in other countries, their real significance appears to have
been overlooked till public attention was directed to the
Irish Crannoges and Swiss Pfahlbauten. It is therefore desirable,
on attempting to give a sketch of the work done in
Scotland in this department of archæology, to give here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
a short account of these Irish and Continental discoveries,
not only because they have been instrumental in opening
up to Scottish antiquaries this wide field of research, the
value of which as a storehouse of ancient relics is hardly
yet realised, but because they enable us, by way of comparison,
to point out some of the differences, as well as
resemblances, of these ancient remains thus nominally
associated under the common title of <span class="smcap">Lake-Dwellings</span>.</p>


<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">Irish Crannogs.</span><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The historic references made to the Irish Crannogs are
numerous, and extend over a long period, from the middle
of the eighth down to the seventeenth century; but notwithstanding
these, it was not till the year 1839 that their
archæological importance became known. In this year Sir
W. R. Wilde discovered and examined the crannog of
Lagore, in the county of Meath, of which he has published
an account in the first volume of the Proceedings of the
Royal Irish Academy. After this other crannogs were discovered
in rapid succession, and it became apparent that
they existed very generally over the country. When Sir
W. R. Wilde published his Catalogue of the Museum (Royal
Irish Academy), in 1857, he states that no less than forty-six
were known, and predicts that many others would be
exposed to view as the drainage of the country advanced&mdash;a
prediction which has been amply verified, because every
succeeding year has seen an increase to their number.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
According to this writer, crannogs "were not strictly
speaking artificial islands, but cluans, small islets, or
shallows of clay or marl, in those lakes which were probably
dry in summer-time, but submerged in winter. These
were enlarged and fortified by piles of oaken timber, and
in some cases by stone-work. A few were approached by
moles or causeways, but, generally speaking, they were
completely insulated and only accessible by boat; and it
is notable that in almost every instance an ancient canoe
was discovered in connection with the crannoge. Being thus
insulated, they afforded secure places of retreat from the
attacks of enemies, or were the fastnesses of predatory
chiefs or robbers, to which might be conveyed the booty
of a marauding excursion, or the product of a cattle raid."</p>

<p>A more recent explorer and writer on Irish crannogs,
Mr. W. F. Wakeman, in a paper entitled "Observations on
the principal Crannogs of Fermanagh," published in 1873,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
goes on to say, after noticing their existence in eighteen
different places in this county, and numbering no less than
twenty-nine, "This glance is far from complete in its
enumeration of the 'Lake Dwellings' still remaining in this
old territory, but it gives, I think, the principal examples.... The
Irish crannog, great or small, was simply an
island, either altogether or in part artificial, strongly staked
with piles of oak, pine, yew, alder, or other timber, encompassed
by rows of palisading (the bases of which now usually
remain), behind which the occupiers of the hold might
defend themselves with advantage against assailants. Within
the enclosure were usually one or more log-houses, which
no doubt afforded shelter to the dwellers during the night-time,
or whenever the state of the weather necessitated
a retreat under cover."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>None of the writers on Irish crannogs appear to have
paid much attention to the structure of these islands, and
beyond the mere statement that they were "stockaded,"
palisaded, or surrounded by one or more circles of piles,
they give no explanation of the attachments and proper
function of the surrounding piles. These are generally
described as having been driven into the muddy bottom of
the lake, and the most essential part of the mechanism of
construction, viz., the horizontal mortised beams, has been
only incidentally noticed. Though the purpose of these
horizontal beams does not appear to have been understood,
it is of importance to observe that their existence has not
been entirely overlooked, as will be seen from the following
quotations.</p>

<p>In his description of the crannog at Lagore near Dunshaughlin,
Sir W. R. Wilde says: "The circumference of the
circle was formed by upright posts of black oak, measuring
from 6 to 8 feet in height; these were mortised into beams
of a similar material laid flat upon the marl and sand
beneath the bog, and nearly 16 feet below the present
surface. The upright posts were held together by connecting
cross-beams, and (said to be) fastened by large iron
nails; parts of a second upper tier of posts were likewise
found resting on the lower ones. The space thus enclosed
was divided into separate compartments by septa or divisions
that intersected each other in different directions; these were
also formed of oaken beams in a state of good preservation,
joined together with greater accuracy than the former, and
in some cases having their sides grooved or rabbeted to admit
large panels, driven down between them."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Reeves, writing about a crannog in the county of
Antrim, says: "These piles were from 17 to 20 feet long,
and from 6 to 8 inches thick, driven into the bed of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
lough, and projecting above this bed about 5 or 6 feet.
They were bound together at the top by horizontal oak
beams, into which they were mortised, and secured in the
mortise by stout wooden pegs."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>My next quotation is from a paper by G. H. Kinahan,
Esq., of the Geological Survey of Ireland, on Crannogs in
Lough Rea: "A little <span class="smcap">N.W.</span> of the double row, in the old
working, there is a part of a circle of piles; and in another,
a row of piles running nearly <span class="smcap">E.</span> and <span class="smcap">W.</span> Mr. Hemsworth
of Danesfort, who spent many of his younger days boating
on the lake, and knows every part of it, informs me that
on the upper end of some of the upright piles there were the
marks of where horizontal beams were mortised on them.
These seemed now to have disappeared, as I did not remark
them."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Wakeman, to whose writings I have already referred,
writes as follows: "It would appear that, in some instances
at least, their spike-like tops were anciently mortised into
holes cut for their reception in beams of oak, which were
laid horizontally. Just one such beam we found undisturbed,
resting on the vertical spike <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in situ</i>. A respectable elderly
man, named Coulter, who resides not far from the lough
(Ballydoolough) informed me that he well recollected to
have seen many of these horizontal timbers resting upon the
stakes or piles. They were hardly ever uncovered, but were
distinctly visible a few inches below the surface of the water.
This I believe to be a feature in the construction of crannogs
but seldom remarked."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>As indications of the social economy and industries
of the occupiers of these crannogs, there were found many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
articles made of stone, bone, wood, bronze, and iron, such as
swords, knives, spears, javelins, dagger-blades, sharpening-stones,
querns, beads, pins, brooches, combs, horse-trappings,
shears, chains, axes, pots, bowls, etc., and within the last few
years, according to Mr. Wakeman,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> many fragments of
pottery, of a similar character to the fictile ware used for
mortuary purposes in the prehistoric and pagan period, have
also been found on some of them.</p>

<p>Many of these relics were deposited in the Museum of the
Royal Irish Academy, but it is to be regretted that, owing
partly to the system of classification now adopted in this
Museum, by which articles are grouped together on the
principle of resemblance, few of them can be identified
or separated from the general collection, so that, except some
articles thrown loosely into a drawer, and labelled as having
been found in the crannogs of Dunshaughlin, Ballinderry,
and Strokestown, no special or representative collection of
crannog-remains now exists in Ireland. Several ancient
canoes are well preserved in the lower portion of the Museum.
Some have square-cut sterns, others have both ends pointed,
some have cross bands, like ribs, left in the solid oak at
regular intervals, as if to strengthen the sides of the vessel,
while others are uniformly scooped out without any raised
ridges. They vary much in size and shape. The largest is
thus referred to in the small handbook to the Museum:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Down the centre of the room extends the largest known
canoe, formed of a single tree. The remains measure 42
feet in length, and the canoe was probably 45 feet long, by
from 4 to 5 feet wide, in its original state. It was recovered
from the bottom of Loch Owel, in West Meath, and cut
into eight sections for purposes of transport. There is a
curious arrangement of apertures in the bottom, apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
to receive the ends of uprights supporting an elevating
deck."</p>

<p>On the antiquity of the Irish crannogs, Sir W. R. Wilde
writes as follows:&mdash;"Certainly the evidences derived from
the antiquities found in ours, and which are chiefly of iron,
refer them to a much later period than the Swiss; while
we do not find any flint arrows or stone celts, and but very
few bronze weapons, in our crannogs. Moreover, we have
positive documentary evidence of the occupation of many of
these fortresses in the time of Elizabeth, and some even
later."&mdash;(<cite>Proceedings of Royal Irish Academy</cite>, vol. vii. p. 152.)
Subsequent researches, however, have shown that all the
desiderated articles above mentioned have been found on
crannogs. For instance, amongst the remains described by
Mr. Shirley, from the crannogs in MacMahon's country, are
stone celts, an arrow-head of flint, two arrow-heads of bronze,
three looped bronze celts, bronze knives, etc.;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and G. H.
Kinahan, Esq., M.R.I.A., thus concludes a short notice on
Irish Lake-Dwellings, contributed to Keller's book (2d
edit. p. 654):&mdash;"Of the time when the crannōgs were first
built there is no known record, but that they must have
been inhabited at an early period is evident, as antiquities
belonging to the stone age are found in them. Some were
in use up to modern times, Crannough Macknavin, County
Galway, having been destroyed in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1610, by the English,
while Ballynahuish Castle was inhabited fifty years ago.
Some crannōgs seem to have been continuously occupied
until they were finally abandoned, while others were deserted
for longer or shorter periods. In Shore Island, Lough Rea,
County Galway, there is a lacustrine accumulation over
3 feet thick, marking the time that elapsed between two
occupations.</p>

<p>"In Wakefield's Island, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1812, attention was directed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
to a crannōg in Lough Nahineb, County Tipperary; but to
the late Sir W. R. Wilde, M.D., is due the credit of bringing
these structures prominently under public notice. This
observer records forty-six crannōgs (<cite>Catalogue, Royal Irish
Academy</cite>, vol. i. p. 220 <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">et seq.</i>), but since then twice as many
have been recorded, most of which are described in the
publications of the Royal Irish Academy, or kindred
Societies; but a systematic classification of the crannōgs
has yet to be made."</p>


<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">Continental Lake Dwellings.</span></p>

<p>Soon after the discovery of the Irish crannogs, the attention
of archæologists was directed to remains of lake-dwellings
in Switzerland. It appears that during the winter
of 1853-4 the inhabitants of Ober Meilen, near Zürich, took
advantage of the low state of the water in the lake to recover
portions of the land, which they enclosed with walls, and
filled in the space with mud. When the workmen began to
excavate, they came upon heads of wooden piles, stone
celts, stags' horns, and various kinds of implements. The
late Dr. Ferdinand Keller, President of the Antiquarian
Society at Zürich, hearing of the discovery, took up the
matter with much energy, and after careful investigation of
the remains at Ober Meilen, came to the conclusion that the
piles had supported a platform, that on this platform huts
had been erected, and that, after being inhabited for many
centuries, the whole wooden structure had been destroyed
by fire. Dr. Keller called these structures pile-buildings
(Keltische Pfahlbauten), but they are more commonly known
in this country as Lake-Dwellings (<cite>habitations lacustres</cite>).
The discovery at Zürich was almost immediately followed
by the discovery of similar structures in the other Swiss
lakes. Owing to the vast system of drainage carried on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
since, there has been a great increase to their number, so that,
at the present time, it is well ascertained that there was
scarcely a sheltered bay in any of the lakes of Switzerland
and neighbouring countries but contained a lake village. The
most common plan adopted by the constructors of these
ancient dwellings was to drive numerous piles of wood,
sharpened sometimes by fire, sometimes by stone celts, or, in
later times, by metal tools, into the mud near the shore of
a lake; cross-beams were then laid over the tops of these
piles, and fastened to them either by mortises or pins of
wood, so as to form a platform. In certain cases the interstices
between the upright piles were filled with large stones,
so as to keep them firmer.</p>

<p>It appears also that the stones were brought in canoes
and thrown down after the piles were driven in, in proof of
which, a canoe, loaded with stones, was found in the Lake
of Bienne, which had sunk to the bottom. Sometimes,
when the mud was very soft, the upright piles were found
to have been mortised into split oak-trees, lying flat at the
bottom of the lake. Other erections were made by layers
of sticks laid horizontally, one above the other, till they projected
above the surface of the water, and thus presented
a somewhat solid foundation for the platform. Upright
piles here and there penetrated the mass, but rather served
the purpose of keeping it together than of giving any support
to the platform. These are called fascine-dwellings, and
occur chiefly in the smaller lakes, and belong, for the most
part, to the stone age.</p>

<p>The regular pile-buildings are far more numerous than
the fascine-dwellings, but, notwithstanding the simplicity of
structure of the latter, they do not appear to be older than
the former, and it is a matter of observation that the civilisation
of the fascine-dwellers corresponds with that of the
inhabitants of other settlements of the stone age&mdash;in fact no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
difference has been observed between the earliest and the
latest dwellings, except that the latter, as the result of
improved tools, were found in deeper water.</p>

<p>The structural resemblance between the fascine-dwellings
on the Continent, the Irish crannogs, and (as it will be
afterwards seen) the Scottish lake-dwellings, is so striking,
that the following, taken from Keller's book (2d edition,
p. 597), is worth recording:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As the Lake of Fuschl is so near the Mondsee (Austria),
it may be included in this notice; and it is somewhat
singular, that here are found decided proofs of a 'fascine'
lake-dwelling, in many respects similar to several found in
Switzerland. This little lake and its banks are rich in fish
and game. On the west side of the hill, where the former
archiepiscopal hunting-lodge stood, there is a small bay
with an island evidently made by human hands. It is
nearly circular, about fifty paces in diameter, and is separated
from the mainland by a narrow ditch or canal, now nearly
filled up with moss and marsh plants. The island is covered
first with a thick layer of peat moss and heather, beneath
which lies a mass of branches, chiefly of the mountain pine
and the dwarf birch. The island is very little raised above
the water, and must have been very liable to be overflowed.
The foundation appears to consist of boughs of pine-trees
with their branches turned inwards. Small piles are driven
in to keep them together, and, on the side of the lake, a
number of stronger piles, or the remains of them, may be
seen, amongst which lies a quantity of woody débris."</p>

<p>From the remains found on the sites of these lacustrine
villages, it is inferred that their occupiers were acquainted
with agriculture, and grew wheat and barley; that they had
domesticated animals, such as cats, dogs, pigs, oxen, horses,
sheep, and goats; that they used as food, besides the flesh
of domesticated and wild animals, fish, milk, corn-meal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
boiled or baked, hazel nuts, plums, apples, pears, sloes,
blackberries, and raspberries; that they were acquainted
with the principles of social government and the division of
labour; and that they manufactured cloth and ropes from
bast and flax by means of looms, and the distaff and spindle.
Their clothing consisted of skins of animals sometimes
prepared into leather, as well as cloth plaited or woven
from flax. Of the kind of huts or buildings erected over
the platforms, little is known owing to their complete decay
from exposure to sun and rain. They appear to have been
rectangular in shape, and formed of wattle or hurdle-work
of small branches, woven between the upright piles, and
plastered over with clay. Each had a hearth formed of two
or three large slabs overlying a bed of clay.</p>

<p>The earliest founders of these dwellings were, according
to Keller, a branch of the Celtic population who came into
Europe as a pastoral people, bringing with them, from the
East, the most important domestic animals.</p>

<p>The absence of winter corn and hemp, most of the culinary
vegetables, as well as the domestic fowl, which was
unknown to the Greeks till about the time of Pericles, points
to the period of their occupancy as a long way antecedent
to the Christian era. Dr. Keller, one of the ablest authorities
on this subject, has come to the conclusion that they were
simply villages inhabited by a peaceful community, that
they attained their greatest development about B.C. 1500,
and that they finally ceased to be occupied about the commencement
of the Christian era.</p>

<p>This wide chronological range embraces the three so-called
ages of stone, bronze, and iron, but it appears that the
settlements belonging exclusively to the stone age were
more numerous and more widely distributed than those of
the metallic period. Bronze age settlements were almost
peculiar to western and central Switzerland, while the iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
age is scarcely represented beyond the lakes of Bienne and
Neuchâtel, so that it would appear that the lake-villages
commenced to decrease in number towards the close of the
former. Of the vast quantity and variety of relics found
on their sites, illustrative of the culture and social organisation
of their occupiers, it is impossible here to give even the
barest description; but this is less necessary, as more
detailed accounts are now easily accessible to general
readers. After the voluminous and well illustrated work of
the late Dr. Keller (as translated by Dr. Lee, 2d ed.), there
is no epitome of the subject more worthy of perusal than
chapter vi. of Sir John Lubbock's great work on Prehistoric
Times, 4th edition.</p>

<p class="p3a">NOTICES, HISTORICAL AND DESCRIPTIVE, OF SCOTTISH LAKE-DWELLINGS
PREVIOUS TO THE YEAR 1878.</p>


<p>It was not till these discoveries on the Continent had
attracted universal attention that Scottish archæologists
began to look for similar remains in this country. It was
then found that early historic references to island forts, and
some incidental notices of the exposure of buried islands
artificially formed of wood and stone, etc., during the drainage
of lochs and marshes in the last, and early part of this,
century, had been entirely overlooked. The merit of correctly
interpreting these remains, and bringing them systematically
before antiquaries, belongs to Joseph Robertson, Esq.,
F.S.A. Scot., who read a paper on the subject to the Society
of Antiquaries of Scotland on the 14th December 1857,
entitled, "Notices of the Isle of the Loch of Banchory, the
Isle of Loch Canmor, and other Scottish examples of the
artificial or stockaded Islands, called Crannoges in Ireland,
and Keltischen Pfahlbauten in Switzerland."</p>

<p>This communication was not published in the Society's
Proceedings, the explanation of which will be found in the
following note, dated June 1866, which forms the introduction
to a valuable article by Dr. Stuart, F.S.A. Scot., on
Scottish Crannogs:<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This paper was not printed in the Proceedings, in consequence
of Mr. Robertson's desire to amplify his notices of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
ancient remains. Other engagements having prevented him
from carrying out his design, he recently placed his collections
in my hands, with permission to add to my account of Scottish
Crannogs anything from his notes which I might care to select.
Of this permission I have gladly availed myself, and the passages
introduced from Mr. Robertson's collection are acknowledged at
the places where they occur.&mdash;J.S."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Robertson's paper, though not published, at once
attracted attention, and stimulated so much further inquiry
on the part of the members, that, at the very next meeting
of the Society, another contribution on the subject was read
by Mr. John Mackinlay, F.S.A. Scot., of which the following
is an abstract. The paper is entitled "Notice of two 'Crannoges'
or Palisaded Islands in Bute, with plans."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>


<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">Dhu-Loch, Bute.</span></p>

<p>"The Crannoge of which I am now to give an account
was discovered by me in the summer of 1812, and is thus
described in a letter, dated 13th February 1813, which I
wrote to the late James Knox, Esq. of Glasgow, who immediately
sent it to his friend, George Chalmers, Esq., author
of <cite>Caledonia</cite>:&mdash;'There is a small mossy lake, called Dhu-Loch,
situated in a narrow valley in the middle of that
strong tract of hill-ground extending from the Dun-hill of
Barone to Ardscalpsie Point, to which valley, it is said, the
inhabitants of Bute were wont to drive their cattle in times
of danger. I remember, when a schoolboy, to have heard
that there were the remains of some ancient building in that
lake, which were visible when the water was low; and
happening to be in that part of the island last summer, I
went to search for it. I found a low green islet about
twenty yards long, which was connected with the shore,
owing to the lowness of the water, after a continuance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
dry weather. Not seeing any vestiges of stone foundations,
I was turning away, when I observed ranges of oak piles,
and on examination it appeared that the edifice had been
thus constructed.</p>

<p>"The walls were formed by double rows of piles, 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> feet
asunder, and the intermediate space appears to have been
filled with beams of wood, some of which yet remain. The
bottom had been filled up to the surface of the water with
moss or turf, and covered over with shingle, or quarry
rubbish, to form a floor. The ground-plan was a triangle,
with one point towards the shore, to which it had been
connected by a bridge or stage, some of the piles of which
are still to be traced."</p>

<p>Mr. Chalmers, in his letter to Mr. Knox of 26th April
1813, relative to the above communication, says:&mdash;"It goes
directly to illustrate some of the obscurest antiquities of
Scotland&mdash;I mean the wooden castles&mdash;which belong to the
Scottish period when stone and lime were not much used in
building. I will make proper use of this discovery of Mr.
Mackinlay."</p>

<p>On revisiting this island in 1826, Mr. Mackinlay observed
"an extension of the fort on the south-east corner, formed
by small piles and a frame-work of timbers laid across each
other, in the manner of a raft."</p>


<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">Loch Quien, Buteshire.</span></p>

<p>There was another insular fort in Loch Quien, which Mr.
Mackinlay describes as a crannog; but not being able to get
on the islet, his measurements are conjectural, and need not
be further referred to. He then states that two rows of piles
extended obliquely to the shore of the lake, between which
the ground was covered with flat stones, "not raised like a
causeway, but rather seeming to have been used as stepping-stones."</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">Dr. Robertson's views on Scottish Crannogs.</span></p>

<p>Before resuming the chronological sequence of further
discoveries, it becomes a matter of duty, on historical grounds,
to refer more particularly to Mr. Robertson's views, notwithstanding
that it is almost entirely to Dr. Stuart's elaborate
paper, published some nine years later, that we are now
indebted for any detailed record of his investigations. At
the same time I shall take the opportunity of giving a few
extracts of the incidental notices of artificial islands culled
from other sources.</p>

<p>In the excellent article on Crannoges in <cite>Chambers's
Encyclopædia</cite> (written, I believe, by Mr. Robertson), the
following epitome of his opinions and researches is given:&mdash;"Hitherto,
archæologists knew of lake-dwellings as existing
only in Ireland and Switzerland; but in 1857, Mr. Joseph
Robertson read a paper to the Society of Scottish Antiquaries,
proving that they were to be found in almost every
province of Scotland. He not only ascertained the existence
of about fifty examples, but was able to show from records
that they were known in Scotland by the same name<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
of Crannoges, which they received in Ireland. The resemblance
between the Scottish and Irish types seems, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
to be complete. Every variety of structure observed in the
one country is to be found in the other, from the purely
artificial island, framed of oak-beams, mortised together, to
the natural island, artificially fortified or enlarged by girdles
of oak-piles or ramparts of loose stones; from the island
with a pier projecting from its side, to the island communicating
with the mainland by a causeway. If there be any
difference between the crannoges of the two countries, it
is that the number of crannoges constructed altogether of
stones is greater in Scotland than in Ireland&mdash;a difference
which is readily explained by the difference in the physical
circumstances, of the two countries. Among the more remarkable
of the Scotch crannoges is that in the loch of
Forfar, which bears the name of St. Margaret, the queen of
King Malcolm Canmore, who died in 1097. It is chiefly
natural, but has been strengthened by piles and stones, and
the care taken to preserve this artificial barrier is attested by
a record of the year 1508.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Another crannoge&mdash;that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Lochindorb, in Moray&mdash;was visited by King Edward <span class="smcap">I.</span> of
England in 1303, about which time it was fortified by a
castle of such mark, that in 1336 King Edward <span class="smcap">III.</span> of
England led an army to its relief through the mountain
passes of Athol and Badenoch.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> A third crannoge&mdash;that of

continued to be a place of strength until 1648, when the
estates of Parliament ordered its fortifications to be destroyed.
It has an area of about an acre, and owes little or nothing to
art beyond a rampart of stones and a row of piles. In the

in times of troubles or wars, for the people put in their goods

hollowed out of the trunks of oaks have been found, as well
beside the Scotch as beside the Irish crannoges. Bronze<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
vessels, apparently for kitchen purposes (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6),
are also of frequent occurrence, but do not seem to be of a
very ancient type. Deer's horns, boars' tusks, and the bones of
domestic animals, have been discovered; and in one instance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
a stone hammer, and in another what seem to be pieces for
some such game as draughts or backgammon, have been
dug up." (Fig. 7.)</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">The Isle of the Loch of Banchory</span>.</p>

<p>"Before the recent drainage of the Loch of Leys&mdash;or the
Loch of Banchory, as it was called of old&mdash;the loch covered
about 140 acres, but, at some earlier date, had been four or
five times as large. It had one small island, long known to
be artificial, oval in shape, measuring nearly 200 feet in
length by about 100 in breadth, elevated about 10 feet above
the bottom of the loch, and distant about 100 yards from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
nearest point of the mainland. What was discovered as to
the structure of this islet will be best given in the words of
the gentleman, of whose estate it is a part, Sir James Horn
Burnett, of Crathes. In a communication which he made to
this Society in January 1852, and which is printed in the first
part of our Proceedings, he quotes from his diary of the 23d
July 1850, as follows:&mdash;'Digging at the Loch of Leys renewed.
Took out two oak trees laid along the bottom of the lake,
one 5 feet in circumference and 9 feet long; the other shorter.
It is plain that the foundation of the island has been of oak
and birch trees laid alternately, and filled up with earth and
stones. The bark was quite fresh on the trees. The island
is surrounded by oak piles, which now project 2 or 3 feet
above ground. They have evidently been driven in to protect
the island from the action of water.' Below the surface
were found the bones and antlers of a red deer of great
size, kitchen vessels of bronze, a mill-stone (taking the place
of the quern in the Irish crannogs), a small canoe, and a
rude, flat-bottomed boat about 9 feet long, made, as in Ireland
and Switzerland, from one piece of oak. Some of the
bronze vessels were sent to our Museum by Sir James Burnett,
and are now on the table (Figs. 3 to 6). The general
appearance of the island as it now is, since the bottom of the
lake was turned into corn land, is represented by Fig. 8. The
surface of the crannog was occupied by a strong substantial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
building (Fig. 9). This has latterly been known by the name
of the Castle of Leys, and tradition, or conjecture, speaks
of it as a fortalice, from which the Wauchopes were driven
during the Bruces' wars, adding that it was the seat of the
Burnetts until the middle of the sixteenth century, when
they built the present Castle of Crathes. A grant of King
Robert <span class="smcap">I.</span> to the ancestors of the Burnetts includes <cite>lacum de
Banchory cum insula ejusdem</cite>. The island again appears in
record in the year 1619, and 1654 and 1664, under the name
of 'The Isle of the Loch of Banchory.' Banchory itself, I
may add, is a place of very ancient note. Here was the
grave of one of the earliest of our Christian missionaries, St.
Ternan, archbishop of the Picts, as he is called in the old
Service-Books of the Church, which add that he received
baptism from the hands of St. Palladius. Along with St.
Ternan's Head and St. Ternan's Bell, called the 'Ronnecht,'
there was preserved at Banchory, until the Reformation, a
still more precious relic, one of four volumes of the Gospel
which had belonged to him, with its case of metal wrought
with silver and gold."&mdash;(<cite>Proc. Soc. Antiq. Scot.</cite> vol. vi. p. 126.)</p>

<p>The following extracts regarding artificial islands incidentally
observed in various parts of Scotland, brought to
light chiefly in the course of drainage operations in search
of marl or for the recovery of boggy land, may be now read
with interest before resuming the narrative of more recent
discoveries:&mdash;</p>


<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">Lochrutton, Kirkcudbrightshire.</span></p>

<p>"This loch is about a mile in length, and half a mile broad.
In the middle of it there is a small island, about half a rood in
extent, of a circular form. It seems to have been, at least in
part, artificial. Over its whole surface there is a collection of
large stones which have been founded on a frame of oak planks."&mdash;(<cite>Old
Stat. Account</cite>, vol. ii. p. 37.)</p>


<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">Loch Kinder, Kirkcudbrightshire.</span></p>

<p>"In Loch Kinder there is an artificial mount of stones, rising
6 or 7 feet above the surface of the water, supposed to have been
constructed for the purpose of securing the most valuable effects of
the neighbouring families from the depredations of the borderers.
The stones stand on a frame of large oaks, which is visible when
the weather is clear and calm."&mdash;(<cite>Old Stat. Account</cite>, vol. ii. p. 139.)</p>


<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">Carlingwark Loch, Kirkcudbrightshire.</span></p>

<p>"When the water was let out of the Carlingwark Loch, in the
year 1765, at the mouth of the drain next to the loch there was
found a dam, or building of stone, moss, and clay, which appears
to have been designed for deepening the loch. Besides this stone
dam there was one of oak wood and earth, at the end of the
town of Castle Douglas, now covered by the military road.
About this place many horse-shoes were found sunk deep in
the mud, of quite a different make from those now in use.
Several very large stag-heads were got in the loch; a large brass
pan was also found in it. Near the south-west corner of the loch
a brass <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pugio</i> or dagger, 22 inches long, and plated with gold,
was raised from the bottom in a bag of marl. Before it was
drained there were two isles in the loch&mdash;the one near the north
end, and the other near the south end of it. These isles were
places of rest for large quantities of water-fowls of various kinds,
which annually came and bred there; even wild geese, it is said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
have been sometimes known to breed on these isles. There was
always a tradition in the parish that there had been a town
in the loch which sunk, or was drowned; and that there were
two churches or chapels&mdash;one on each of the large isles....
The vestige or foundation of an iron forge was discovered on
the south isle. Around it, likewise, there had been a stone
building, or rampart; and from this isle to the opposite side, on
the north-east, there is a road of stone secured by <em>piles of oak
wood</em>, with an opening, supposed to have been for a drawbridge.
In several places of the loch canoes were found which appear to
have been hollowed, after the manner of the American savages,
with fire. On a small isle, near the north end of the loch, there
was found a large iron mallet or hammer stained on one end
with blood. It is now in the hands of the Antiquarian Society
at Edinburgh, and is supposed to have been an instrument used
by the ancient Druids in killing their sacrifices. On several of
the little isles in the loch were large <em>frames of black oak</em>, neatly
joined. There are two small isles that have been evidently
formed by strong piles of wood driven into the moss and marl,
on which were placed large frames of black oak. The tops of
these were fully 6 feet under water before the loch was drained.
The design of these works is not at present known."&mdash;(<cite>Old Stat.

<p>A large bronze caldron, found by Mr. Samuel Gordon and
J. T. Blackley while fishing near the Fir Island, and dredged out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of the loch, contained a large number of iron and bronze implements
(Fig. 10). When this caldron was raised, it was shining like
gold. Mr. Gordon thinks it was left by Edward I., who had a
camp on the Fir Island, and that it was deposited to prevent the
Gallovidians getting any metal in their possession. A bronze
sword was also found in this Loch, which is now in the National
Museum, Scotland.&mdash;(<cite>Proc. Soc. Antiq. Scot.</cite> vol. vii. p. 7; and

<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">Loch Spinie, Morayshire.</span></p>

<p>"Near it (the Bishop's Palace), where the water is deepest, a
small artificial island emerged, upon clearing out the canal, of an
oval form, about 60 by 16 paces, appearing to be composed of
stones from the quarry, bound together by crooked branches of
oak, and as if the earth, with which it was completed, had
been wholly washed off during its submersion."&mdash;(<cite>Old Stat. Account</cite>,
vol. x. p. 625.)</p>


<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">Loch of Boghall, Beith, Ayrshire.</span></p>

<p>"In the map of Cunninghame in Bleau's Atlas, published in
1654, there is laid down a piece of water called the Loch of
Boghall. This loch belonged to the Monastery of Kilwinning,
and was of old called Loch Brand. In the <cite>Acta Dominorum Concilii</cite>
there is mention made of a case, 10th December 1482, at the
instance of the Abbot and Convent of Kilwinning against, etc.
etc., who were accused of the dangerous destruction and down-casting
of the fosses and dikes of the Loch called Loch Brand....
The loch was drained about sixty years ago, when firm stakes of
oak and elm were found in the soil, and which had been used
for fixing the nets for fishing."&mdash;(<cite>New Stat. Account</cite>, vol. v. p. 580.)</p>


<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">Parish of Culter, Lanarkshire.</span></p>

<p>"In the midst of a morass, half a mile north-east from the
farm of Nisbet, may be seen a very singular remnant of
antiquity. A mound of an oval shape, called the Green Knowe,
measuring about 30 yards by 40, rises about two or three feet
above the surface of the surrounding bog. On penetrating into
the elevating mass, it is found to consist of stones of all different
kinds and sizes, which seem to have been tumbled promiscuously
together without the least attempt at arrangement. Driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
quite through this superincumbent mass are a great number of
piles, sharpened at the point, about three feet long, made of oak
of the hardest kind, retaining the marks of the hatchet, and
still wonderfully fresh. A causeway of large stones connects this
mound with the firm ground."&mdash;(<cite>New Stat. Account</cite>, vol. vi. p. 346.)</p>


<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">Loch Rannoch, Perthshire.</span></p>

<p>"There are two small islands situate in the upper end of the
lake. The east and large one is wholly artificial, resting upon
large beams of wood fixed to each other. This island was sometimes
used as a place of safety in cases of emergency; at other
times, as a place of confinement for such as rebelled against or
offended the chief. To this retreat there is a road from a point
on the south side&mdash;which road is always covered with 3 or 4
feet of water, is very narrow, and has a great depth on both
sides of it."&mdash;(<cite>New Stat. Account</cite>, vol. x. p. 539.)</p>


<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">Parish of Croy, Inverness-shire.</span></p>

<p>"In draining a lake at the east-end of the parish, an artificial
mound appeared within a few yards of the shore, about
60 feet in circumference, and 5 feet in height. It was formed
of alternate strata of stones, earth, and oak; piles of oak being
driven in the ground were kept strongly fixed by transverse
beams of smaller size. Over these were round stones, and on
the surface some inches of fine black mould. Some fragments
of brass rings, pieces of potteries, and the bolt of a lock, of no
ordinary size, were found on the mound.</p>

<p>"At about 100 yards' distance there is a circle of large piles
of oak, driven deep in the earth, apparently the commencement
of a second mound; but for what purpose they were intended it
is impossible to conjecture. They could not be places of defence,
as the one finished was so near the edge of the lake, and completely
commanded by the opposite rising bank. While draining
the lake by cutting a deep canal, oaks of gigantic size were found
more than 20 feet below the surface, as sound as the day they
were overwhelmed by water, sand, and gravel. At the same
time a canoe of most beautiful workmanship was found, which
some modern Goth has since cut down for mean and servile
purposes."&mdash;(<cite>New Stat. Account</cite>, vol. xiv. p. 448.)</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">Lochs of Kinellan and Achilty, Contin, Ross-shire.</span></p>

<p>"In Lake Kinellan stands an artificial island, resting upon
logs of oak, on which the family of Seaforth had at one period
a house of strength.... There is still in Loch Achilty a small
island, likewise supposed to be artificial. It belonged to Mac
Lea Mor, <em>i.e.</em> Great Mac-Lea, who possessed at the same time
a large extent of property in the parish; and who was wont, in
seasons of danger, to retire to the island as a place of refuge
from his enemies. The ruins of the buildings which he there
occupied may still be traced."&mdash;(<cite>New Stat. Account</cite>, vol. xiv.

<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">Loch Cot, Parish of Torphichen.</span></p>

<p>"The loch lies at the foot of the southern slope of Bowden
Hill, and is now drained. An old man who belonged to Dr.
Duns's (New College, Edinburgh) congregation when he was at
Torphichen, more than once described to him the appearance of
the loch before it was drained&mdash;'its central island, and the big
logs taken from it and burned.' Horns were also found in the
loch, but were neglected, and have disappeared. Dr. Duns
found part of a quern on an examination of the site; and on
digging into a mound at a short distance eastward from the loch,
he found an urn of rude type. To the south are the remains of
a circular earthwork; and to the south-west, traces of what has
been called a Roman camp; and to the south, a camp of peculiar
form, noticed by Sibbald."&mdash;(Dr. Stuart's article, <cite>Proc. Soc.

<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">Castle Loch, Lochmaben.</span></p>

of the seventeenth century. "Ther was of ancient ane lord in
Loquhaber, called my Lord Cumming, being a cruell and tyirrant
superior to the inhabitants and ancient tenants of that countrie
of Loquhaber. This lord builded ane iland or an house on the
south-east head of Loghloghae; ... and when summer is,
certain yeares or dayes, one of the bigge timber jests, the
quantitie of an ell thereof will be sein above the water. And
sundrie men of the countrie were wont to goe and se that jest

<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">Loch of the Clans, Nairnshire.</span></p>

<p>In 1863 a paper by Dr. Grigor of Nairn was read at the
Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, in which the author
describes a curious cairn with "oak beams and sticks cropping
out in it," and surrounded by a ploughed field which
was formerly part of the basin of the Loch of the Clans,
from which I give the following extracts:&mdash;</p>

<p>"On getting down into the cairn, we found that all the
wood in sight was chiefly the remains of rafters, and inclined
upwards at about an angle of 25 degrees, so as to form an
upright roof. These, however, had been broken across (as
represented on the sketch, Plate I.), no doubt by their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
partial decay and the superincumbent weight of stones. On
further clearing and digging, we came upon four sides or walls,
each about 3 feet in height, and making an irregular square.
These were formed of trees of oak, comparatively sound, and
about thirty years' probable growth. On the west side,
there were seven trees piled horizontally, one above the
other; the third from the ground had another alongside it.
Seven trees also formed the east side. The north side was
made up of a foundation of small boulders, then two horizontal
trees, over which projected a few rafters, and then
another tree. At the east end of this wall there was a
mortised opening, in which, in all probability, an upright
support had been placed. The south side had been, to all
appearance, partially removed when that end of the cairn
was carted off by the tenant-farmer, and only one tree at the
bottom was seen. These sides are correctly represented in
the accompanying sketches, and the scale renders it unnecessary
to particularise measurements. The floor was the
mud bottom of the old loch, and there were two small trees
stretching from east to west, with the appearance of decayed
brushwood throughout, and a boulder stone here and there.
Not exactly in the centre, but nearer the south-east corner,
lay a few boulders bearing marks of fire, and having portions
of charcoal around them. This was all that could be seen
as a hearth.</p>

<p>"Nothing of any interest was found in the way of clearance.
There were portions of decomposed bones, a bit of
pottery (evidently modern), the mouth-piece of a horn spoon,
and a cockle shell, and these probably had fallen through
the cairn.</p>

<p>"To all appearance the rafters started from the ground in
three tiers, having different angles of inclination, though
those of the roof seemed to have run up pretty much together
near the ground. These were bound down by beams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
crossing and recrossing in all directions, which imparted
greater strength. Beyond two mortised openings no other
mode of fastening could be seen."</p>

</div>

<p>The articles found in the course of the explorations of
this cairn, or crannoge, were a portion of a small stone cup,
two whetstones, and an iron axe-head, together with charcoal
and burnt bones. In the vicinity there were found some
flint arrow-heads and flakes, and, some years ago, a canoe.</p>

<p>"About 150 feet, in a south-easterly direction from this
place, and in marshy ground, were found a great many pile-heads,
covered with grass and vegetable matter; and after
removing this covering they stood as shown in the accompanying
plan and scale. This is no doubt the foundation of
another crannoge or lake habitation. An area of 6 feet in
the centre seemed, so far as I examined, to have been laid
with large stones, and intersected with small trees and
stakes. Beyond this space I observed no stones, only the
mud of the lake, and a few bits of small trees. Three stones
in the centre seemed marked by fire; and below those I
turned over, and under water, there was a good deal of charcoal
mixed with small bits of bone.</p>

<p>"In the neighbouring 'Loch of Flemington,' and covered
with several feet of water, are to be seen, when the water is
frozen over, similar remains of piles.</p>

<p>"In the east end of the small pond called 'Loch in
Dunty,' about two miles in a westerly direction from that of
Flemington, are to be observed three vestiges of piles about
a foot above water; these, notwithstanding the evidence of a
Highlander living close by, 'that the piles had been put
into the loch in auld time, for the purpose of steeping the
lint,' are, in my opinion, of the same description, day
and generation, as those I have attempted to describe in
the Loch of the Clans."&mdash;(<cite>Proc. Soc. Antiq. Scot.</cite> vol. v.

<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">Loch of Sanquhar, Dumfries-shire.</span></p>

<p>In June 1863, Dr. Grierson of Thornhill announced, at a
meeting of the Dumfries-shire and Galloway Natural History
Society, that an ancient stockade had been found in a small
loch near Sanquhar. He observed, "that about five weeks
ago, a man drowned himself in a tarn about two miles north
of Sanquhar. In order to recover the body, the water was
drained off, when it was found that a small island in the
middle of the loch or tarn was artificial, and had been constructed
of stakes with stones between, and had been
approached by a zigzag line of stepping-stones. It was
thought that the loch might be altogether artificial, forming,
as it were, a moat or fosse to the little fort."&mdash;(<cite>Proceedings</cite>,
Session 1863-4, p. 12.)</p>

<p>During the summer of 1865, the members of the Society
made an excursion to this loch for the purpose of examining
the crannog, the result of which is described by the President
(the late Sir W. Jardine, Bart.) in his annual address,
and from which the following extracts are taken:<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This loch is of considerable depth, and now covers about
2 acres. At the north end of this there is a small island covered
with a rank vegetation of grasses, carices, etc., mixed with a few
plants of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Epilobium angustifolium</i>, and there are also a few stunted
trees of Scotch fir and birch. At the north or north-east end
there is a natural outlet from the loch through the moss, which
could be easily deepened." ... (This outlet was deepened previous
to their visit, and the water drained off so as to facilitate
the examination of the island.)</p>

<p>"When first seen, after the bottom was laid dry, a few
upright piles were observed, and the curving narrow passage
from the mainland appeared somewhat raised, and was hard
below the immediate mud deposit, as if a sort of rough causeway
had been formed; and when the water was at its height, or
nearly level with the surface of the island, persons acquainted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
with the turn or winding of the passage could wade to it. The
base of the slope of the island was laid or strengthened with
stones, some of considerable size, so placed as to protect the
wooden structure. Round the island could be seen driven piles,
to which were attached strong transverse beams, and upon
making a cut 6 or 7 feet wide into the side of the island
to ascertain its structure, we found a platform of about 4 feet
in depth raised by transverse beams placed alternately across
each other, and kept in position by driven piles. These last
were generally self oak trees, but dressed and sharpened by a
metal tool, some of them mortised at the heads where a transverse
rail or beam could be fixed. The transverse beams, of
various sizes, were chiefly of birch wood.... On the surface
of the island there were some indications of buildings, but on
examination these were found to be only the erection of curlers
for fire, or the protection of their channel-stones when not in use.
No remains of any kind were found on the island nor around it,
but, except on the passage from the mainland, the mud was
so deep and soft as to prevent effectual search. Neither have
we any record of any other remains being found in or near the
loch except the canoe already alluded to. It is formed out of a
single oak tree, 16 feet in length by 3 feet broad at the widest
part, at the prow only 1 foot 10 inches."</p></blockquote>


<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">Loch Barean, Kirkcudbrightshire.</span></p>

<p>The following facts were communicated to the author by
John J. Reid, Esq., F.S.A. Scot., Edinburgh:&mdash;</p>

<p>Loch Barean, situated in a mountainous patch in the
parish of Colvend, is about five miles from Dalbeattie, and
not far from the main road leading from this town to
Colvend Manse. It is a deep peaty sort of a loch, very
irregularly shaped, measuring about 1950 feet in length,
with a breadth varying from 600 to 1150 feet, and is
bounded on the east by a barren ridge of rock which runs
along its margin. In 1865 the level of this loch was
lowered by drainage, when a few stones, which used to
become visible in dry summers, turned out to be an artificial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
island constructed of wooden beams. Shortly after exposure,
it was visited by the late Sir W. Jardine, Dr. Stuart,
Secretary to the Society of Antiquaries, and others, and
found to be surrounded by a circle of oak piles enclosing a
wooden flooring. "None of these piles were visible above
the water. On this oak piling beams had been laid horizontally,
some oak and some of fir still retaining the bark. The
space within this piling was nearly circular in shape, and
measured about 24 feet in diameter; but, outside the piling,
and between it and the loch, there was an area, from 5 to 8
feet wide, filled with angular granite blocks to assist in
protecting the wooden flooring."</p>

<p>Two metal "pots" were found on the island, of which
only one now remains. It is of thin beaten bronze, flat-bottomed,
with bulging sides and everted lip. Its dimensions
are: height 5 inches, diameter of mouth 4<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inches, do. of
bottom 3<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inches, and do. in middle 5<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inches.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>


<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">Crannogs in Loch Dowalton.</span></p>

<p>A more important discovery, made about the same time,
was a group of artificial islands in Lake Dowalton, Wigtownshire,
which were first described by Lord Lovaine, in a paper
read to the British Association in 1863. Mr. John Stuart,
Secretary to the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, then
took up the subject, and, owing to a greater drainage of the
loch having been made in the interval, was enabled to
re-examine the Dowalton islands under more favourable
circumstances. The result of his labours was an elaborate
paper to the Society, in which he gave a detailed account of
the structure and relics of these crannogs, and also took the
opportunity of incorporating into his article all the facts he
could glean, so as to afford a basis for comparing the Scottish
examples with those in other countries. I have taken advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of some of the contents of this paper on a previous
occasion when discussing Mr. Robertson's investigations of
Scottish crannogs. The following is the substance of Dr.
Stuart's examination and report of the Dowalton group:<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>The late Loch of Dowalton was of an irregular form,
about 1 1&frasl;2 mile long, and about 3&frasl;4ths of a mile in greatest
breadth, and without any marked outfall for drainage. Sir
William Maxwell effected this by making a cut, 25 feet
deep, through the wall of whinstone and slate which closed
it in at its south-eastern extremity. Dr. Stuart, who
availed himself of Lord Lovaine's previous description of the
island abodes that became visible on the drainage of the
loch, describes them in order of succession, beginning at
the west end:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The first is called Miller's Cairn, from its having been a
mark of the levels, when the loch was drained by cuts for
feeding neighbouring mills. One of these cuts is known to
have been made at a remote period. It was still surrounded
by water when the place was visited by Lord Percy in 1863.
On approaching the cairn, the numerous rows of piles which
surrounded it first attracted notice. These piles were formed
of young oak-trees. Lying on the north-east side were
mortised frames of beams of oak, like hurdles, and, below
these, round trees laid horizontally. In some cases the
vertical piles were mortised into horizontal bars. Below
them were layers of hazel and birch branches, and under these
were masses of fern, the whole mixed with large boulders,
and penetrated by piles. Above all was a surface of stones
and soil, which was several feet under water till the recent
drainage took place. The hurdle frames were neatly mortised
together, and were secured by pegs in the mortise holes.</p>

<p>"On one side of the island a round space of a few feet in
size appeared, on which was a layer of white clay, browned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and calcined as from the action of fire, and around it were
bones of animals and ashes of wood. Below this was a
layer of fern and another surface of clay, calcined as in the
upper case. A small piece of bronze was found between
the two layers. On the top another layer of fern was found,
but the clay, and the slab which probably rested upon it,
had been removed. There can be no doubt that this had
been used as a hearth. Near this cairn a bronze pan was
found.... Lines of piles, apparently to support a causeway,
led from it to the shore.</p>

<p>"The next in order is the largest island. Lord Percy
succeeded in reaching it in a boat in 1863. It appeared to
him to be 3 feet below the level of the other islands, and,
from several depressions on its surface, to have sunk. The
progress of excavation was, however, soon checked by the
oozing in of the water. On the south side of the island great
pains had been taken to secure the structure; heavy slabs
of oak, 5 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 2 inches thick, were
laid one upon another in a sloping direction, bolted
together by stakes inserted in mortises of 8 inches by 10
inches in size, and connected by square pieces of timber
3 feet 8 inches in length. The surface of the island was of
stones, resting on a mass of compressed brushwood, below
which were branches and stems of small trees, mostly
hazel and birch, mingled with stones, apparently for compressing
the moss. Below this were layers of brushwood,
fern, and heather, intermingled with stones and soil, the
whole resting on a bed of fern 3 or 4 feet in thickness.
The mass was pinned together by piles driven into the
bottom of the loch, some of which went through holes in
the horizontal logs. I noticed some of these flat beams of
great size and length (one of them 12 feet long), with <em>three
mortise holes</em> in the length, 7 inches square. A thick plank
of oak of about 6 feet in length had grooves on its two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
edges, as if for something to slide in. This island measured
23 yards across, and was surrounded by many rows of piles,
some of which had the ends cut square over, as if by several
strokes of a small hatchet. Vestiges of branches were
observed interlaced in the beams of the hurdles. On the
north-east side, and under the superstructure of the island
(hurdles and planks), a canoe was found, made of a single
tree of oak. It was 21 feet in length, 3 feet 10 inches
across over all near the stern, which was square. Its depth
at the stern was 17 inches, or, including the back-board
which closed the stern, 20 inches. The stern was formed
by a plank inserted in a groove on each side, with a back-board
pegged on above it. The part containing the grooves
was left very thick. There were two thole-pins on each
side, inserted in squared holes in the solid, which was left to
receive them, and wedged in with small bits of wood. One
thwart of fir or willow remained. A plank or wash-board
projecting a few inches over the edge, ran round the canoe.
It rested on the top, and was fastened with pegs into the
solid....</p>

<p>"On one spot a few flat stones were placed as if for a
hearth. The best saucepan was found between this island
and the shore. A small circular brooch of bronze, four whetstones,
two iron hammers, and some lumps of iron slag, were
found <em>on</em> the island. A third iron hammer was found near it.</p>

<p>"The original depth from the surface of the island to the
bottom was probably from 6 to 7 feet; but the structure was
much dilapidated before I saw it.</p>

<p>"Proceeding southward, we come to the island first
examined by Lord Percy. It proved to be nearly circular,
and to be about 13 yards in diameter. Its surface was
raised about 5<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> feet above the mud, and on each side of
it were two patches of stone nearly touching it. On the
north side lay a canoe of oak, between the two patches, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
surrounded by piles, the heads just appearing above the
surface of the mud. It was 24 feet long, 4 feet 2 inches
broad in the middle, and 7 inches deep, the thickness of the
bottom being 2 inches. Under the stones which covered
the surface, teeth of swine and oxen were found. A trench
was cut round the islet, and at the south end a small
quantity of ashes was turned up, in which were teeth and
burned bones, part of an armlet of glass covered with a
yellow enamel, and a large broken bead of glass, together
with a small metal ornament; two other pieces of a glass
armlet, one striped blue and white, were also found on the
surface. These objects were found on the outside of the islet,
about 2 feet from the surface. On cutting into the islet
itself, it proved to be wholly artificial, resting on the soft
bottom of the loch, and in its composition exactly the same
as the large island already described. The whole mass
was pinned together by piles of oak and willow, some of
them driven 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> feet into the bottom of the loch. The islet
was surrounded by an immense number of piles, extending
to a distance of 20 yards around it; and masses of stone,
which apparently were meant to act as breakwaters, were
laid amongst them. On the sinking of the mud, a canoe
was found between the islet and the northern shore. It
was 18<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> feet long, and 2 feet 7 inches wide. A block of
wood cut to fill a hole, left probably by a rotten branch, was
inserted in the side, 2 feet long, 7 inches wide, and 5<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches
thick, and was secured by pegs driven through the side;
across the stern was cut a deep groove to admit a back-board;
in both canoes a hole 2 inches in diameter was bored in the
bottom.</p>

<p>"The next islet is about 60 yards from the last, and
nearer to a rocky projection, on the south margin of the
loch. It was examined by Lord Percy and was found to be
smaller; the layers were not so distinctly marked, and some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
of the timbers inserted under the upper layer of brushwood
were larger, and either split or cut to a face. A stake with
two holes bored in it about the size of a finger, a thin piece
of wood in which mortises had been cut, and a box, the
interior of which was about 6 inches cube, with a ledge to
receive the cover, very rudely cut out of a block of wood,
were found.</p>

<p>"On the south-east side of the loch, near one of the little
promontories, were several cairns surrounded by piles, of
which the outline had mostly disappeared at the time of my
visit. When they were first seen by Lord Percy, there were
six structures of the same character as those already described,
arranged in a semicircle. They were, however, much smaller
than the others, and appeared to have been single dwellings.
Though upon some of them charred wood was found, nothing
else was discovered except a mortised piece of timber, which
might have been drifted there; and in one, inserted under
the upper layer of brushwood, a large oak beam, measuring
8 feet long by 3 in circumference.</p>

<p>"This group of small islets was close to the shore. They
had, however, been surrounded by water at the time the
level of the loch reached the highest beach-mark. I could
not discover any causeway or piled connection with the
shore.</p>

<p>"Near the north margin of the loch, a canoe was found
in the mud. It measured 25 feet in length, and was
strengthened by a projecting cross band towards the centre,
left in the solid in hollowing out the inside."</p>

<p>The relics found in the course of these investigations at
Dowalton Loch were presented to the Society of Antiquaries
of Scotland by Sir William Maxwell of Monreith in 1865,
and they are now deposited in the National Museum, Edin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>burgh.

<p>On the 14th of March 1881, R. Vans Agnew, Esq.
of Barnbarroch, presented to the Museum of the Society
of Antiquaries of Scotland, a
brooch or ornamental mounting
of bronze, found in Dowalton
Loch, Wigtownshire, of which
Fig. 26 is a representation. It
is ornamented with trumpet-shaped
spaces, probably filled
with enamel, and measures
2 inches in diameter. Mr.
Vans Agnew gives the following
account of the circumstances
in which it was discovered:&mdash;"The
bronze ornament or brooch was found last summer in
the bed of the Loch of Dowalton by Master Alexander
Gibson, grandson of Mr. Alexander Cumming, the venerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
tenant of the farm of Stonehouse, on the shore of the lake.
It was then seventeen years since the lake was drained. I
have not been able to ascertain the exact spot where it was
found, but it was not far from the site of some of the
crannogs."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>The following is Professor Owen's report of the bones
which were submitted to him for examination:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The bones and teeth from the lake-dwellings, submitted
to my examination by Lord Lovaine, included parts of the
ox, hog, and goat. The ox was of the size of the <em>Bos longifrons</em>,
or Highland kyloe, and was represented by teeth,
portions of the lower jaw, and some bones of the limbs and
trunk. The remains of the <em>sus</em> were a lower jaw of a sow,
of the size of the wild boar, and detached teeth. With the
remains of the small ruminant, of the size of the sheep, was
a portion of a cranium with the base of a horn core, more
resembling in shape that of the he-goat. Not any of these
remains had lost their animal matter.&mdash;R. O."</p>

<p>In December 1867 a paper, by the Rev. R. J. Mapleton,
Corr. Mem. S. Ant. Scot., Kilmartin, was read at the meeting
of the S. A. Scot., describing an artificial island in Loch
Kielziebar, near the Crinan Canal. The author thus sums
up his observations:&mdash;"Altogether, I think that it is evident
that the crannog was entirely composed of rock and walling,
with the middle part filled up with smaller stones: that
there existed considerable works of wood on the east, south,
and west sides, at least, but whether a rampart outside, or a
building on the structure itself, is not quite clear; that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
was a partial causeway, now under water, and the interval
either filled in with brushwood, or passed over in a canoe."&mdash;(<cite>Proc.
Soc. Antiq. Scot.</cite> vol. vii. p. 322.)</p>

<p>In June of the following year Mr. Mapleton gives a
description of stockaded remains discovered twelve years
previously upon the partial drainage of a fresh-water loch at
Arisaig, in the parish of Ardnamurchan, Inverness-shire.
This loch was of an irregular oval form, and lay in a comparatively
level tract of land, with very low braes at a short
distance from its shores. It communicated with the sea
by a small burn. The crannog was of a rectangular shape
(43 by 41 feet), but owing to the surrounding mud it was
impossible to ascertain how the foundation of the crannog
had been formed. "Outside of the building is a range of
sharpened posts, fixed in the bottom of the loch, and inclining
inwards towards the crannog, leaving a space of about
3 feet of water between them and the building. These posts
are beautifully pointed, being quite round towards the ends,
as though made by small sharp instruments. We counted
eight still standing on one side. The crannog appears to
have been formed altogether of very large round logs, or
rather of trees with the bark left on, and the side branches
neatly cut off. They are of various lengths: one that we
were able to measure being 29 feet long, and 5 feet in circumference,
at about 2 feet above the base. Another log
was closely fitted to this, so as to extend through the whole
breadth of the building. The ends did not overlap, but had
been neatly cut or worn off, so as to be placed quite close to
each other.</p>

<p>"We tried to dig down into the structure, and found at
least four layers of these large trunks placed very regularly
across each other. We could not dig deeper, as the water
began to ooze in; but by using a probe, we felt timbers at a
depth of 8 feet below our digging. The wood is chiefly oak,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
but there are some logs of birch.... On the surface were
several large flagstones, especially in three spots. These
bore strong marks of fire, and the logs on which they rested
were much charred. Beneath and around them we found
charcoal, several small pieces of calcined bone, shells of
hazel-nuts, and one very small chip of flint, together with
several rough angular pieces of white quartz. At each of
the four corners of the structure there were two sharpened
stakes inclining towards each other and the building, leaving
a small space between them; and at one end (viz. the south-east)
there was one large log of oak 39 feet long, and 5 feet
6 inches in circumference at the base. Two great logs were
nicely rounded off at the end, and a hollow was scooped out
in the wood, about 2 or 3 inches deep, and 4 inches broad.</p>

<p>"Upon rowing up to the structure, when it first appeared
above the surface of the falling water, the men first came to
a kind of rampart, that ran on all the four sides, about 3
feet distant from the structure, and about 18 inches higher
than the apparent level of the floor of the crannog. This
was formed by large trees that were kept in their place by
the upright sharpened posts, whose sharp points projected
about 1 foot above the trees. The ends of these trees were
scooped out in the same manner as the two that still remain;
and they were firmly fixed in their places between the two
sharpened posts at each corner, which fitted into the hollow
made by the scooping. No signs of a causeway were observed,
neither could we detect any symptom of one, though
we carefully probed the mud all round. 'Lord Abinger
informed me that when a loch on his property, Torlundie,
Fort-William, was drained, there was a kind of structure
with timbers in it, which were unfortunately scattered and
destroyed, as Mr. Stuart had not then made known the
existence of crannogs in Scotland, and drawn attention to
them.'"&mdash;(<cite>Proceedings</cite>, vol. vii. p. 516.)</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">Artificial Islands in Mull.</span></p>

<p>In June 1870, the following note by Farquhard Campbell,
Esq. of Aros, Mull, was read at the meeting of the Society of
Antiquaries of Scotland.&mdash;(<cite>Proceedings</cite>, vol. viii. p. 465.)</p>

<p>"The loch called <em>Na Mial</em>, in English <em>Of Deer</em>, is about a
mile south of Tobermory, and about 150 feet above the level
of the sea, and 50 acres in extent. There was in the loch one
of the artificial islands which are found in almost all the lochs
of Mull. I drained the loch, which was only about 6 feet
deep of water, blasting a passage through whinstone rock
20 feet deep. The mud under the water is of great depth. Of
course, we had to make deep drains round the loch to catch
the water. On coming with the drain to the edge of the loch,
opposite this island, a large canoe was found 4 feet under the
surface of the mud. The canoe was of black oak, 17 feet in
length and 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> feet beam, quite fresh and sound. Several
canoes of a smaller size were also found, but near the surface
of the mud, and in a half-decayed state. Three boats of
modern <em>clinker-built</em> construction, of whose history none of
the natives had any knowledge, were also found. I had the
large canoe dug out of the mud and put into the sea, in
order that, being saturated with salt water, it might be preserved
from cracking. There is another loch on my property
which has two of these artificial islands. The loch is
large&mdash;about 1500 acres. I may also mention that, close to
the site of the large canoe, I found <em>a stone causeway laid
upon oak-trees</em>. This was at the same depth under the surface
of the mud (viz., about 4 feet). This causeway led direct
to the artificial island, which was formed of a quantity of
loose stones, on the only rock near the surface of the water
in the whole loch."</p>


<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">Lake-Dwellings of Ledaig and Lochnell, Argyllshire.</span></p>

<p>Dr. Angus Smith, F.R.S., in a communication to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Society of Antiquaries of Scotland in 1871, describes, among
other antiquities near Loch Etive, lake-dwellings at Ledaig
and Lochnell, the former of which, notwithstanding the
limited and inadequate inspection it has undergone, presents
some features of interest, which the reader will find in the
following extracts from Dr. Smith's report.&mdash;(<cite>Proc. Soc.
Antiq. Scot.</cite> vol. ix. pp. 93 and 105.)</p>

<p>"About one hundred and twenty years ago a company
from England, engaged in working iron, had diverted a
stream from this to the east, and made dry ground where
was a lake.</p>

<p>"The space that called forth interest was scarcely distinguishable
from the rest of the moss. A little attention, however,
showed a depression. The whole was of a brownish-green
colour, but in the middle of the depression, where had
been the old lake, there was a part greener than the rest.
It was of an oval form, about 50 feet long, and 28 feet
broad. The outer part had a double row of tufts, as if two
walls had existed. I expected piles at these places, but the
whole was soft and consisted of turf only. On digging
down, about 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> feet, we came to wood, consisting of young
trees from 6 to 8 inches in diameter, lying packed closely
together. Under these there was another larger layer crossing,
and under these again more. There seemed four all
along the building. This was opened in three parts, and the
same layers of wood were seen....</p>

<p>"At the east end of the oval was an elongation not surrounded
by the turf mound. I believe the foundation extends
along it. I suppose this to have been a platform before
the door, a place for the inhabitants to sun themselves, and
a landing and disembarking spot. (This platform was afterwards
found to extend all round.)</p>

<p>"In the middle nearly, but a little to the westerly end,
of the oval house was the fireplace. It is higher than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
rest of the space. It was here that the bones were found,
with shells and nuts. Under a few inches of a white powder
is the hearth. It consists of four flattish stones; under the
stones are to be found more peat ashes and some few remnants,
but very few, of the substances connected with food.
Under the ash was a floor of clay about 6 inches thick."</p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Smith, having resumed excavations here on a subsequent
occasion, remarks (<cite>Proc. Soc. Antiq. Scot.</cite> vol. x. p. 82):
"A little more was exposed this year, and a third fireplace
found at the north-western end. On each side, a little
towards the front, was a raised seat. This was a bank of
earth on which were placed flattish stones. These were the
arm-chairs of the inhabitants. Amongst the rubbish outside
the wall were found two or three piles, the meaning of which
is not yet made out. Two
broken combs made of
wood were obtained, one
of which is shown in the
annexed woodcut (Fig. 27).</p>

<p>"A piece of wood with
a cross burnt on it caused
a good deal of interest.
This kind of cross is not
uncommon in the older Irish forms. It is a Greek cross
with crosslets, and has been imagined to indicate a time
before the Latin Church entered."</p>

<p>A small island in Lochnell is supposed by Dr. Smith,
after a slight examination, to be another lake-dwelling.</p>


<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">Crannogs in Wigtownshire.</span></p>

<p>In the same year (1871), the Rev. George Wilson, Glenluce,
contributed a paper to the Society of Antiquaries of
Scotland (<cite>Proceedings</cite>, vol. ix. p. 368), on the Crannogs and
Lake-Dwellings in Wigtownshire, from which it would appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
that all the lakes in this locality were once literally studded
with these island habitations. He enumerates no less than
ten lakes, each of which contained one or more crannogs.
The abundant remains of stakes, mortised beams, and the
occasional discovery of a "paved ford" connecting the
islands with the shore, sufficiently indicate their structural
formation; but beyond this, and the important fact of their
existence in such numbers in the district, they present
nothing of a novel or special character calling for a more
detailed notice here. (See tabular statement, p. 245.)</p>

</div>

<p>Regarding stone implements, with circular central hollows
wrought on each face, one of which (Fig. 29) was found on
a crannog in Machermore Loch, Mr. Wilson writes thus:<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>&mdash;"These
are of two types, elongated and oval, approaching a circular form, and
I wish to direct attention to them, because, as yet, only eight have
been reported in Scotland, seven of them being from Wigtownshire."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>On a later occasion, June 15th, 1881, Mr. Wilson, writing
on the same subject, says:&mdash;"In the volume of the Proceedings
for 1879-80, at pages 127-129, I have described
seven of these stones, and have stated that only one specimen
has been reported from any other part of Scotland. I
now direct attention to eleven more from Glenluce and
Stony Kirk added to the Museum, making eighteen from
Wigtownshire."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> (See notice of another, found on the crannog
in Lochspouts, at page 173.)</p>

<p>One of the crannogs referred to by Mr. Wilson, viz., that
in "Loch Inch-Cryndil," or Black Loch, was about the same
time subjected to a careful examination, a report of which
was drawn up by Charles E. Dalrymple, Esq., F.S.A. Scot.
(<cite>Proc. Soc. Antiq. Scot.</cite> vol. ix. p. 388), from which I quote the
following illustrative extracts:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The island is oval in shape, 180 feet long, and 135
feet broad in the widest part. It has tolerably deep water
round it, excepting towards the nearest shore, a distance of
about one hundred yards, where, in dry seasons, it does not
exceed 6 or 7 feet....</p>

<p>"In the middle of the island, which is thickly covered
with trees of thirty or forty years' growth, but with a few
much older toward the south end, a circular mound appeared,
resembling a low tumulus, 45 feet in diameter, rising in the
centre to about 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> feet in height, round the edges of which
there were, in some parts, traces of a low wall of three or
four courses of small stones, like a miniature dike. The
island rises gradually from the water to the base of the
mound, which at that season (the beginning of October) was
about 18 inches above it, so that the top of the mound,
which was the highest part of the island, was then about
5 feet above the loch. Spacious cuttings were made in the
centre, afterwards extended to the edge of the mound in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
various directions, with the following results:&mdash;The island
proved to have been a crannog, formed apparently on a shoal
in the lake, composed of shingle over blue clay, the object
having obviously been to raise a platform which would be
above the water even when the lake was at its fullest, as,
even at the present time, there is a considerable rise in the
wet months, although pains are taken to keep clear the outfall
from the loch. The mound was found to be of earth
and stones mixed, extending beneath which, at a depth of
5 feet in the centre, but decreasing in depth towards the
edge, was found a flooring of trunks of trees, oak and alder,
in two layers, crossing each other at right angles in some
places, in others lying rather confusedly. These were mostly
not more than 6 or 8 inches in diameter, but one solitary
trunk of an oak, near the centre, lying at a higher level, and
possibly the remains of a hut or other superstructure, was
fully two feet in diameter, although much decayed. These
layers of wood were traced as having covered a circular
space about fifty feet in diameter, thus agreeing nearly with
the size as well as the shape of the mound.... The extent
of the mound would appear to have been that of the crannog
proper, but the existence of a solitary oak pile, 50 feet from
it, on the weather side of the island, makes it probable that
either a breakwater had been placed there, as was also
supposed to be the case in Dowalton Loch, or a 'chevaux-de-frise'
of sharp-pointed stakes for defence.</p>

<p>"At different levels, from that of a few inches above the
timber flooring to 3 feet higher, and over the whole mound,
were found many fireplaces, one or two covered over with
two long stones, leaning against each other lengthways, like
the roof of a house, but most of them formed by placing two
long narrow stones (fragments of the rock of the district,
which breaks off easily in that form) parallel with each
other, leaving a space between, which was paved with small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
stones and formed a hearth. Large quantities of bones of
animals, mostly more or less burnt, and, whether flat or
round bones, frequently split, were found mixed with the
ashes and charcoal which lay in and around these hearths,
in some places extending over wide spaces, which were
marked, also, by masses of burnt yellow clay."</p>

<p>At different levels, in different parts of the mound, were
found the following objects,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> the description of which I take

<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">Crannog at Tolsta, Lewis (1874).</span></p>

<p>The following account of a crannog is from a letter by
Peter Liddle, Esq., to the secretary of the Society of Antiquaries
of Scotland (<cite>Proceedings</cite>, vol. x. p. 741):&mdash;</p>

<p>"In a lake recently drained at Tolsta, I have examined
a crannog which seems to me to possess some interest. A
drain has been cut through part of the crannog, which
affords a section of its construction. At the outside there
is a row of piles 5 or 6 inches diameter, then large stones,
then another row of piles, then heather and moss&mdash;the whole
covered with earth and gravel. The remains of three houses
built of unhewn stones are still visible upon it. All round
the crannog, but inside the outer row of piles, there is an
immense quantity of shells, plentifully intermixed with
bones, ashes, and twigs of trees. The shells are those of the
ordinary edible shell-fish, the mussel being the most common.
The bones are chiefly those of deer, and the small Highland
sheep still found on the island. The only implement I
found was part of a stag's horn, with the brow-antler
thinned. Three hollowed stone vessels or knocking-stones
were found on the surface, but they were destroyed or lost
sight of. A causeway of large stones under water led to the
crannog."</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Fig 31.&mdash;Canoe found in Loch Arthur.</p></div>
</div>


<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">Loch Lotus, Kirkcudbrightshire.</span></p>

<p>During the summer of 1874, a canoe (Fig. 31) was discovered
in Loch Arthur, or Lotus Loch, in the stewartry of
Kirkcudbright, in the vicinity of a small artificial island
which is thus described by Rev. James Gillespie (<cite>Proc. Soc.
Antiq. Scot.</cite> vol. xi. p. 21): "When fully exposed to view by
the trench which was dug around it, the canoe was seen to
be of great size, ornately finished, and in a fair state of
preservation. It had been hollowed out of the trunk of an
oak, which must have been a patriarch of the forest, the
extreme length of the canoe being 45 feet, and the breadth
at the stern 5 feet. The boat gradually tapers from the
stern to the prow, which ends in a remarkable prolongation
resembling the outstretched neck and head of an animal.
When excavated this portion of the canoe was entire. At
the neck of the figure-head, there is a circular hole about
5 inches in diameter from side to side. At the prow a small
flight of steps has been carved in the solid oak from the top
to the bottom of the canoe. The stern is square, and formed
of a separate piece of wood, inserted in a groove about an
inch and a half from the extremity of the canoe. The stern-board
board when found was in a fragmentary condition, so
that it is impossible to say whether it consisted of one or
several planks.</p>

<p>"Along the starboard side (which when found was in good
preservation except near the stern), there could be traced
seven holes about 3 inches in diameter. The three front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
holes were nearly perfect, but at the stern the side was so
broken that only the lower parts of the holes could be
observed. They are about 5 feet apart, and the front hole
is about that distance from the prow&mdash;the last being about
7 feet from the stern. There are three holes pierced through
the bottom at irregular intervals.</p>

<p>"In connection with the discovery of this canoe, it is
worthy of remark, that on the opposite side of the lake,
between three and four hundred yards from the spot where
the canoe was found, there is a small circular island which
is evidently artificial. It is about 100 feet in diameter, and
is approached by a stone causeway about 30 yards long,
which was laid bare last summer by the lowness of the lake.
The artificial nature of the island may be seen by the remains
of the oaken piles driven in in rows, with horizontal beams
between, which can still be traced in the water round the
north-east and south sides. The lines of two small enclosures
can be followed on the south side of the island.</p>

<p>"No excavations have yet been made on the island, but
ashes and other signs of fire were found many years ago."</p>


<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">Crannog in the Loch of Kilbirnie, Ayrshire.</span></p>

<p>At the meeting of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland
in June 1875, Robert Love, Esq., F.S.A. Scot., gave a
description of a crannog in the loch of Kilbirnie, of which
the following is a condensed account.&mdash;(<cite>Proceedings</cite>, vol. xi.
p. 284.)</p>

<p>"There was a little island in the upper end, and near the
north-west corner of this loch; and most who knew it when
entire, 50 or 60 years ago, are agreed that it was essentially
circular, although some little pointed towards the south.
It was elevated, at least in modern times, above the water of
the loch in its ordinary state, from 2 to 4 feet; and on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
surface was entirely overlaid with stones of the boulder sort,
not large, and which might have been got on the margin of
the lake. Some say that beams or logs, and piles of wood
were noticed during protracted droughts on or along the
margin of the island, but if they were, it notwithstanding
never occurred to any one that the island was other than
natural. In the summer of 1868, however, its artificial
nature became quite evident. This was occasioned in consequence
of the slag from the furnaces having been for
several years, and in great bulk, deposited within the loch
to the west of and behind this island, which sunk down
through the soft yielding mud deposit there, which is of the
great depth of 30 or 40 feet, a fact that was ascertained by
borings near the site of the furnaces. This had the effect,
while it overlay and bore down that part of the island which
is towards the west, of moving the east portion of it forward
and into the loch, and, at the same time, of upheaving it so
that it was elevated considerably above the water. In consequence,
this part spread hither and thither and split up;
many fissures were the result, both in the artificial deposits
and in the underlying mud, which were of a depth that
varied from 4 to 6 feet; and it was by means of these that
the various artificial strata became disclosed.</p>

<p>"It has been said that the surface of the island throughout
was overlaid or paved with stones. The depth of these was
not great, possibly not more than from 1 to 2 feet, there
not being in any part that became visible more than two
courses. Wood ashes were discovered on the surface&mdash;a
portion being also found a little below, and some of the
stones at one part, in particular the fragments of a sandstone
flag, bore distinct evidence of the action of fire; and it was
supposed that this flag might have been the hearth of some
structure reared on the surface. These stones are to be held
as the uppermost artificial stratum. The next in descent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
was a layer of large coarse water-borne gravel mixed with
finer sand, which was of the depth of from 18 inches to
2 feet. The third layer was brushwood, boughs of trees,
among which the hazel predominated, ferns, etc. etc., but
the whole was so compressed as not to manifest a greater
depth than about 6 inches. The fourth layer was beams or
logs of wood, some of which were nearly 2 feet in diameter,
although the greater number was less. These seemed laid
down horizontally, and so as to cross or intersect each other,
similar to a raft of wood; some of them showed that they
had been mortised or checked into each other, or into vertical
piles, and that the tenons when inserted had been fastened
by wooden pins, and in one or two instances by large
iron nails.</p>

<p>"The whole of this wood-work, however, when exposed,
was in a greatly disturbed and loosened condition from the
movement and upheaval of the structure; and, in consequence,
what space in depth these cross-beams occupied
was not ascertainable. Then the fifth and lowest stratum
was the underlying mud, which was fine, pure, and free of
stones, and not at all like boulder clay. Besides, there was
manifested as having been planted on the surface, one if not
more wooden structures, houses or huts they might be, small
in size, and one of which at least was in the form of a
parallelogram, having been constructed of small round posts
of wood used in forming the sides and ends. How it had
been roofed did not appear. There were seen also bits of
bone, as those of birds, as well as a few teeth, similar to
those of the cow or ox. Trees, for the most part of a low
stature, were over all parts, as well as reeds and other coarse
grasses which sprang up between the stones on the surface.</p>

<p>"Then as regards the <em>margin</em> of this island, it appeared to
have been palisaded; at least this was the case on its north-east
side&mdash;that which only was visible. The piles used for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
this purpose were apparently of oak, and not great in girth;
they were driven down into the mud bank as the foundation;
and on these, as well as upon the beams, the cutting
of an edged tool, not a saw, was quite distinct. Within
these vertically placed piles, and resting on the surface,
stones, it is said, were placed, which was the case more
certainly around the whole margin. It is also said that
stones were even placed outside of these piles, in a row, and
on the very margin; but it is only probable that <em>outwith</em>
this row there had been an outer course of piles, by means
of which the stones were kept in position, but which, from
weathering, had gone into complete decay.</p>

<p>"It is known that this island was approachable by means
of a kind of stone causeway which led from the north-west
margin of the lake. According to the report of those who
saw it often, it was only of the breadth of 2 or 3 feet, and
was never visible above the water of the loch, which on
either side is said to have been 6 or 7 feet in depth. It is
not said that this causeway was protected or fortified in any
way by piling. It was near the south end of this causeway,
along the north-east margin of the island, that in 1868
several canoes or boats, as many it was believed as four, in
a less or more entire condition, were discovered. Only one
of these, however, when found, was partly entire, and it
even wanted some 2 feet at the bow to render it complete.
But as this canoe, formed out of a single tree, and the bronze
utensils which were found imbedded in mud within it, have
been well described in Mr. Cochran-Patrick's paper, printed
in the Society's Proceedings (vol. ix. 385), none of these need
now be referred to, further than to say that the pot, the
repair or clouting of which was with <em>iron</em>, is not by any
means uncommon in shape."</p>

hollowed out of a single tree, and was about 18 feet in
length, 3 feet in breadth, and close on 2 feet in depth. It
was broadest at the stern, which was square, and tapered
towards the bow, and was entire, with the exception of
about 2 feet broken off the narrowest end. There were
indications that a hole in the bottom had been mended, and
some wooden pins were in it which may have been used for

that the one now shown wants the curious ornament projecting
from the breast, though the place where it has been
inserted is quite apparent. The bronze pot is 11 inches
across the mouth, stands 14 inches high, and weighs 28 lbs.
It resembles what are often called Roman camp-kettles.
There are indications of its having been ingeniously mended."</p>

<p>This concludes a brief historical and descriptive sketch
of ancient lake-dwellings, as known in Scotland previous to
the excavation of the Lochlee Crannog in 1878-9, a full
report of which will be found in the next chapter. From
this sketch it will be seen that, during the interval between
the publication of Dr. Stuart's paper in 1866 and the above
date, if we except the occasional notice of the discovery of
a new site, comparatively little has been done by way of
furthering the systematic exploration of their widely-scattered
remains. With the formation, however, of the Ayrshire
and Wigtownshire Archæological Association, a new
epoch in antiquarian research may be said to have dawned
on the south-west of Scotland. One of the features of this
Association is the prominence given to <em>practical explorations</em>
as a means of investigating the prehistoric remains of the
district, the beneficial result of which may be estimated by
the fact, that, with a trifling exception, all the discoveries
recorded and illustrated in the following pages are due to
its inspiration, and have actually appeared, in the first
instance, in its publications. These, however, constitute
but a small part of the investigations conducted under the
guidance and auspices of this most active Association.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="p3a">REPORT OF THE DISCOVERY AND EXAMINATION OF A CRANNOG
AT LOCHLEE, TARBOLTON, AYRSHIRE (1878-9).</p>


<p><em>Discovery of the Crannog.</em>&mdash;The site of the Lochlee Crannog
was a small lake, now entirely dried up, which formerly
occupied portions of a few fields on the farm of Lochlee near
Tarbolton. The lake was surrounded by a gently undulating
country, and lay in a hollow, scooped out of the glacial
drift, at an elevation of about 400 feet above the sea-level.
Taking a fair estimate of its former extent by a careful
examination of sedimentary deposits near its shore, it was
ascertained, from accurate measurements and levelling, that
its area was about 19 acres; but, owing probably to the
accumulation of moss and silt, it is known, in modern times,
to have been much greater, especially during winter.
Before it was artificially drained, some forty years ago, no
one appears to have surmised that a small island, which
became visible in the summer-time, and formed a safe habitation
for gulls and other sea-birds during the breeding season,
was formerly the residence of man; nor am I aware of any
historical notices or traditions that such was the case; nor
does it appear to have attracted the attention of the poet
Burns, though he lived for four years on this farm in the
capacity of ploughman to his father, then tenant of the
place. The crannog was near the outlet of the lake, and the
nearest land, its southern bank, was about 75 yards distant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
When the first drainage of the place was carried out, the
wrought wood-work exposed in the drains passing through
the island, and especially the discovery of two canoes buried
in the moss, attracted the attention of the workmen. The
shop of a provision merchant at Tarbolton happened to be
much frequented by the drainers, and in this way the shopkeeper,
Mr. James Brown, came to hear of the finding of the
canoes, and the conjectures of the men as to the artificial
nature of the island. Mr. Brown, who seems to combine the
true spirit of the antiquary with his business habits, never
lost sight of the little island at Lochlee and the information
he had ascertained regarding it, and on various occasions
since, mentioned the subject to gentlemen who, he thought,
were likely to take an interest in it. The recent re-drainage
of the same locality revived Mr. Brown's curiosity about
the structure of this island, now a slight mound in a field,
and being himself unable, owing to the infirmities of age, to
take any active part in inspecting it, he wrote a letter about
the beginning of September to a gentleman at Ayr suggesting
an inquiry into the matter; but as the latter did not
seem inclined to take it up, a week afterwards he wrote a note
to Mr. Anderson, of the National Museum of Antiquities in
Edinburgh. This gentleman, recognising the importance of
his information, immediately communicated with R. W.
Cochran-Patrick, Esq. of Woodside, Hon. Secretary of the
Ayr and Wigtown Archæological Association, who lost no
time in visiting the locality, and at once discovered the true
nature of the mound. Mr. Cochran-Patrick then sent a note
to Mr. Turner, factor to the Duke of Portland, under whose
supervision the drainage was being conducted, informing him
of the discovery, and suggesting, in the interests of Archæological
Science, that an examination of the crannog should
be made. Meantime these facts were communicated to me
by Mr. J. H. Turner, and having had my attention already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
directed to Lake Dwellings in consequence of a recent
opportunity I had of inspecting some of their relics preserved
at Zürich, I also became interested in ascertaining the
exact nature of the find at Lochlee. Next day Mr. J. H.
Turner and I visited the locality, and in the course of a few
more visits found ample evidence that the mound was really
artificial, and had been at some former period the site of a
human habitation. At the same time, as if to deepen our
curiosity, a small canoe, hollowed out of a single trunk of
oak, was dug up by the workmen out of the moss which
formed the bottom of the lake. It was then kindly arranged
by Mr. Turner, senior, that some excavations would be made
so as to ascertain more accurately the structure of this
mound. The general appearance which it presented after
these excavations were commenced, as seen in Fig. 33,
was that of a grassy knoll, drier, firmer, and slightly more
elevated, than the surrounding field. Unfortunately, the
large deep main drain which happened to pass through and
cut off a segment of this mound, was filled up before attention
was directed to its archæological importance, so that
we lost the opportunity of inspecting the section which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
presented to view. Upon careful inspection, however, we
noticed towards the circumference of the mound the tops of
a few wooden piles barely projecting above the grass, which
at once suggested the idea that they might be portions of a
circular stockaded island. Guided by these, I completed
what we supposed to be the circumference of the original
island, by inserting pins of wood where the piles were
deficient. Following the line thus indicated, the workmen
were ordered to dig a deep trench round the mound, but to
leave whatever wood-work would be exposed as much as
possible <em>in situ</em>. Accordingly, this trench was completed,
and on the following day, 15th October 1878, systematic
explorations were begun in presence of Messrs. Turner,
J. H. Turner, Cochran-Patrick, Anderson, Dr. Macdonald
(Ayr), and myself.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 33.&mdash;The Crannog after the Excavations were commenced.</p></div>
</div>

<p><em>The Excavations.</em>&mdash;The space enclosed by this trench
was of a somewhat circular shape, and about 25 yards in
diameter. The trench was from 5 to 6 feet deep, and in
many parts quite studded with wooden piles, mostly upright,
but some slanting. Some of those slanting outwards were
forked at the upper end, as if intended to counteract outward
pressure. At the bottom of the trench, particularly on
the north side, were found various kinds of brushwood,
chiefly hazel and birch, here and there trunks of trees, thick
slabs of wood, and large stones. The most remarkable
objects, however, were thick planks of oak about 6 feet long,
with a large square-cut hole at each end. These were visible
at various portions of the trench, and lying half-way down,
some right across and others with one end sticking out from
its inner side. At the north-east side there were two rows
of these beams exposed, four in each row, and about 5 feet
apart, measuring from the central line of each beam. One
row was a little farther out than the other, and had upright
piles, somewhat squarely cut, projecting through the holes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
These horizontal beams pointed towards the centre of the
crannog, and appeared to keep the upper ends of the upright
piles in position (see Figs. 34, 35, and 36). Lying
underneath these beams, and at right angles to them, were
round logs of wood varying in length from 6 to 15 feet,
which being caught as it were by the upright piles, were prevented
from falling outwards into the trench. Conterminous
with the mortised beams, which were scarcely a foot under
the surface, there was a rude and much decayed platform of
rough planks and saplings resting on transverse beams of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
split oak-trees. One of these transverse beams which I
measured was 14<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> feet long and 8 inches broad, and for
a few inches at each extremity was not split, so that the
portion thus left acted as a catch (for the planks above it),
like the flange on the wheel of a railway wagon. Digging
underneath this platform, we passed through a compact mass
of clay, stones, beams of soft wood, and ultimately brushwood,
underneath which, being on a level with the drain, we
could not farther explore, owing to the oozing up of water.</p>

</div>

<p>We then commenced digging a few feet to the west of
the centre of the mound, and soon cleared a trench from 3 to
4 feet deep, about a couple of yards broad, and directed
almost due north and south. About 25 feet from the outer
trench, measuring northwards, and 53 feet in the opposite
direction, we came upon the south edge of a smooth pavement
neatly constructed of flat stones. Judging from ashes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
charcoal, and small bits of burnt bones which were here
observed, that this pavement was a fireplace, we thought it
better in the meantime to leave it intact; so we formed
another trench at a width of 8 to 10 feet, at right angles to
the former, and just touching the southern edge of the pavement,
which was continued eastwards till it touched the
platform already described. A circular trench was then
made round this pavement, at a breadth of about 4 feet,
leaving it, with its superincumbent soil, standing in the
centre. We had thus a considerable space cleared out at a
uniform level, with a small portion of the pavement visible,
and an oval-shaped mass of soil about 4 feet in diameter
above the rest of it. In the course
of these excavations we found three
upper quern stones, portions of other
two, a wooden vessel in two fragments,
a large quartz pebble (Fig.
37), with markings as if made by
a hammer on its surface, portion of a
pointed horn (Fig. 91), some bones, one or two hammer-stones,
and a boar's tusk.</p>

</div>

<p>Upon careful inspection we then discovered immediately
above the pavement, at a height of 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> feet, and rather less
than a foot from the surface of the mound, another pavement
similar to the former. These pavements rested on layers of
clay which extended several feet beyond them, and gradually
thinned out towards the edge. On a level with the
lower pavement we found the remains of a series of massive
stakes with square-cut ends, which appeared to surround it.
They were very much decayed, and it was difficult to ascertain
their original number, but seven were noted, which
were kept standing in position for some time. Two well-shaped
plank-like beams were lying horizontally at the east
side of the lower pavement, and on a level with it. The distance
between these upright stakes varied from 2 to 4 feet,
and, as already noticed, they were not pointed at their bases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
but cut across. One, indeed, we found to have a small portion
projecting from the centre of its base, which neatly
mortised into a hole formed by a piece of wood, a flat stone,
and some clay. On a subsequent occasion, when digging
lower, we came upon another of these stakes which had
pressed down the portion of clay on which it rested nearly a
foot. The lower pavement slanted a little to the south-west,
and it was also observed that the bottoms of the stakes were
somewhat lower in that direction. On the north side they
came close to the pavement, but on the south extended about
5 feet beyond it. The upper pavement was about a foot
nearer the outer trench, in the direction of the wooden platform
already described at its north-east corner, and hence it
only partially covered the lower. It was carefully built with
stones and clay round a wooden stake, corresponding with
the series of stakes on a level with the lower pavement, and
the layer of clay underneath it extended eastwards over one
of the horizontal beams above referred to. Both these pavements
were neatly constructed of flat stones of various sizes,
and about an inch and a half thick, and had a raised rim
round them also formed of flat stones, but uniformly
selected and set on edge. They were slightly oval in shape,
and the major and minor axes of the lower one measured
5 and 4 feet respectively. Traces of other pavements between
the upper and lower were observed, but before further
examination was made the whole mass above the lower or
first-discovered pavement was trodden down by visitors.</p>

<p>At this stage I have to record the loss of the active
services of Mr. Cochran-Patrick, who hitherto took notes
and sketches of each day's proceedings. In consequence of
his absence, owing to a protracted illness, and the inability
of the other gentlemen to attend, this duty now fell on my
inexperienced shoulders; and in giving this short account
of the work, I have only to say that, however imperfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
done, I have endeavoured, during very inclement weather,
to procure as correct and faithful a record of the explorations
as possible.</p>

<p>While making a tentative digging on the south side of
the lower pavement, I ascertained that the soil underneath
its corresponding layer of clay (which, by the way, extended
much farther than any of the other layers) contained boars'
tusks, broken bones, and charcoal. After digging for about
4 feet below the level of the pavement, we came upon a
layer of chips of wood as if cut by a hatchet, and below
this a thick layer of turf with the grassy side downwards.
Water here oozed up, but with the spade I could readily
distinguish that underneath the turf there were large logs of
wood extending farther in all directions than I could then
ascertain. With a pole we took the perpendicular height of
the level of the surface of the upper hearth above these
logs, and it measured exactly 7 feet 9 inches, so that the
greatest depth of the accumulated rubbish since the logs
were laid, <em>i.e.</em> about centre of mound, would be about 8<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> feet.
I then determined to clear the soil entirely away round the
fireplace down to these logs, still keeping the surrounding
trench at the same breadth as before, viz., 4 to 5 feet. While
this was being done we inspected the stuff as it was removed,
though I now regret this was not done more carefully, and
found a great variety of manufactured implements of various
materials. Observe that the portion here referred to is well
defined,&mdash;above by the layer of clay corresponding to the
lower or first-discovered pavement, and below by the newly-discovered
log pavement. It is fortunate that this was the
case, as it turned out so prolific of relics that I have assigned
to it the name of <em>relic-bed</em>. Amongst these were a spindle
whorl (Fig. 66), two bone chisels (Figs. 69 and 70), and
several pointed bone implements (Figs. 71 to 74), a polished
stone celt (Fig. 55), a metal knife (Fig. 129), some imple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>ments
of horn and wood, a fringe-like object manufactured
of the stems of a moss (Fig. 151), and a great many hammer-stones.
Close to the pavement, but about 2 feet lower, we
extracted the skeleton of an animal like that of a goat or
sheep, the skull of which was entire, and had short horn-cores
attached to it. The relic-bed was made up of partially
decomposed vegetable matters, and could be separated into
thin layers; the common bracken, moss, parts of the stems
of coarse grass, heather, and large quantities of the broken
shells of hazel nuts, were frequently met with. The bones
were generally broken as if for the extraction of their
marrow. The bed of chips of wood was several inches
thick, and extended more than half-way round, and had its
maximum extent on the south-west side. The logs, all of
which were oak, and cut at various lengths, from about
6 feet to 12 feet, seemed to radiate from the central line of
the fireplace, like the spokes of a wheel. Underneath these
logs were others lying transversely, and in some places
a third layer could be detected by probing with a staff.
None of these layers of logs were disturbed at this stage of
the proceedings.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>A perpendicular section made of the central mass left
standing, just touching the southern edge of the first-discovered
pavement, and looking towards the south, presented
the appearance of stratified rocks of various colours, of
which the above is a sketch. At the bottom is the log
pavement; then in succession you see turf, clay, a black
line of ashes; then again clay, another line of charcoal and
ashes, and lastly, the pavement imbedded in a thick layer
of clay. The upper pavement and intermediate section are
not represented, as they were demolished by visitors some
days previous to the taking of the sketch. Upon removing
this central mass of clay and ashes intervening between the
stony pavement and the log pavement, Dr. Macdonald and
I made the important discovery that there were other two
stony pavements corresponding exactly with the charcoal
lines in the drawing. The one was 18 inches below the
first-discovered pavement (or that figured in the drawing,
and which has hitherto been called the lower pavement),
and the other 16 inches still lower, and about a similar
distance above the logs. Both these pavements were slightly
oval in shape, about 4 feet in diameter, and beautifully built
with flat stones and raised rims round them, precisely similar
to the two already described. While in the act of demolishing
these fireplaces we came upon another entire skull of a sheep
or goat, with horn-cores attached to it, very like the one
already mentioned, and found near the same place. At the
north-east side, close to the fireplaces, were a few large
stones built one above the other, and poised evenly with
wedges of wood and stones. A little to the north of these
stones, and about 4 feet from the base of the fireplaces, there
was a portion of a large square-cut upright stake, a few feet
long, resting on a flat circular board, like the bottom of
a barrel, and supported by the log pavement. On the south
side of the stones, and close to them, was a round flat piece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
of oak, with a hole in its centre, somewhat like a quern
stone. My fist could just go through this hole, and when
found it had a small plug of wood loosely fitting it. Near
the same place portions of a large shallow dish made of soft
wood, and a small bit of a three-plied rope of withs, were
picked up. About 5 feet to the south of the centre of the
pavements there was a portion of another upright stake
resting on the log pavement. Although various other
portions of decayed stakes and pins of oak were found while
excavating within a few feet of the fireplaces, they were not
so systematically arranged as to suggest the idea that they
formed the remains of a surrounding hut, as was undoubtedly
the case with those corresponding to the first-discovered
pavement, and already described.</p>

<p>Before proceeding further, let me pause for a moment
and endeavour to recall, in a few words, the salient points
already arrived at, and the reasons that led to the next
steps in our investigation. At a portion of the outer trench,
it may be remembered, there was found, about a foot under
the surface, a rude wooden platform resting on a complete
solid basis, which then, naturally enough, was supposed to
be the surface of the artificial island; and towards the centre
a series of at least four hearths, one above the other. Now
the level of the lowest hearth was about 3 feet below that of
the wooden platform. What then was the cause of this
difference in their level? Did the central portion sink from
the weight of the superincumbent mass, or was it originally
constructed so? Again, although the fireplaces were nearly
equidistant from the trench, measuring east and west (about
39 feet), they were eccentric in the diameter at right angles
to this line, being, according to the measurements already
given, about 14 feet north of the centre of the space enclosed
by the trench. It was therefore evident that nothing short
of the removal of a large portion of the central débris would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
be sufficient to give a correct idea of the log pavement and
its surrounding structures, and disclose the treasures supposed
to be hidden in it. Having adopted this resolution,
the men were instructed accordingly, and at once commenced
excavating directly south of the fireplaces. Part of the soil
was thrown back into the empty space where the fireplaces
stood, and the rest wheeled into the field beyond. The space
thus inspected was about 25 feet broad, and extended southwards
31 feet from the fireplace. At its southern end we
came upon a curved row of upright piles, most of which had
the appearance of being dressed like square-cut beams, which
penetrated deeply below the log pavement, and appeared to
bound it in this direction. Amongst the relics found here
were a pair of querns, portions of a wooden plate (Fig. 103),
curious wooden implements (Figs. 118 and 119), a wooden
hoe lying immediately above the log pavement, and close
beside it some black vegetable substance like hair, and a few
bone and horn implements. At its south-east corner we
just touched the edge of a thick bed of ashes and bones,
which will be described fully by and by.</p>

<p>We next removed a broad slice from the portion left
standing to the west of the fireplace, and in consequence of
certain peculiarities in the arrangement of numerous piles
and horizontal beams observed at the north-west corner
(see Fig. 40), we determined to remove altogether the broad
ring now left between the outer trench and the space cleared
in the interior.</p>

<p>It would be rather tedious to describe the various details
of this work minutely; besides, it is not necessary in order
to convey a general idea of the results obtained. It was
a work of many weeks, of great toil and labour, and of much
and varied comment by outsiders. One or two visits to the
crannog seemed to satisfy the curiosity of most people.
There were, however, a few gentlemen whose enthusiasm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
never fagged, amongst whom I have specially to mention Mr.
James Blackwood, F.S.A. Scot., who by constant attendance
and counsel rendered valuable aid in the successful accomplishment
of these excavations. It will therefore be more
convenient to arrange the further observations I have to make
in detailing the progress of the excavations under the
following heads:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <em>Log Pavement and its surrounding Wooden Structures.</em>&mdash;After
clearing the whole space enclosed by the original circular
trench down to the level of the log pavement, it was
still difficult to make out the general plan of its structure,
and that of the superstructure erected upon it. In the
centre there was a rectangular space about 39 feet square,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
having its sides nearly facing the four cardinal points, and
a flooring of thick oak beams somewhat like railway sleepers
(see Figs. 40, 41, and 42). The fireplaces were nearly in the
centre, but a little nearer its northern side. The wooden
pavement was more carefully constructed at the south side
than under the fireplaces; although, quite close to the latter,
on its eastern side, were found two beautiful slabs of oak,
which were removed, and measured 12 feet by 1 foot 6
inches. These beams had a series of round holes extending
along the whole length of one edge, and about 5<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches
apart. They appeared quite symmetrical, as if formed by an
auger, and had a diameter of about 1 inch, and a depth of
2 or 3 inches. Close to the southern side of this rectangular
space, there were exposed two very curious beams 7 feet
9 inches apart, and lying over a thin layer of clay which
intervened between them and the general log pavement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
One was slightly curved, and both had a raised rim running
along their whole length, and each had a horizontal hole
through which the ends of a beam passed (see Fig. 42).
Moreover, they had square-cut holes at right angles to the
former, as if intended for uprights. The finding of a double-bladed
paddle (Fig. 126), close to one of these beams,
suggested to the men the idea that they were the remains of
a large boat, which, I must say, they very much resembled.
Below this clay, and lying immediately over the log pavement,
a long piece of a charred beam and the blade-half of
an oar were found.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_084.jpg" width="500" height="272" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 42.&mdash;Curious Beams lying over Log Pavement.</p></div>
</div>

<p>At the south-east and south-west corners of the wooden
pavement the remains of what appeared to be partitions or
walls, running northwards, were noticed (see Figs. 40 and
42). These were constructed of short uprights and long
slender beams laid along the line of partition, and interspersed
with a matty substance like bast, together with clay
and earthy matter. At the south end, the logs forming the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
pavement were laid parallel to each other and in groups,
some running north and south, and others at right angles to
these. There were two and sometimes three layers of logs,
each lying transversely over the other. At the ends of the
upper layers there were here and there deeply penetrating
piles slightly projecting above the flooring, with a horizontal
beam stretched between and tightly jammed, apparently for
the purpose of keeping the logs in position. About 12 or 13
feet from the south side, a straight row of these piles and
stretchers ran across the log pavement, which, at first sight,
I took to be the remains of a partition (see Plan of Crannog,
Plate II.).</p>

<p>Surrounding the rectangular log pavement, and just
touching its four corners, we could trace a complete circle of
firmly-fixed upright piles, arranged in two rows from 2 to 3
feet apart. They were all made of oak, apparently young
trees, and projected several feet above the surface of the
pavement, some of which were observed on the grassy surface
of the mound before excavations were commenced.
The most important thing, however, about them was the
mode in which they were connected together by transverse
beams, similar to, but ruder than, those already described as
found at the north-east corner of the outer trench. Some of
these beams were bevelled at the ends on their upper surfaces,
especially the outer ends, and had two holes, one at
each end, through which the pointed ends of the uprights
projected. Fig. 41 shows one in its original position. At its
inner end there were two strong wooden pins in a slanting
direction, which entered the mortised hole through lateral
grooves on its under surface and jammed the upright. The
ends of these pins diverged and rested on clay, stones, and
pieces of wood, and were evidently inserted for the purpose
of supporting it. One transverse beam, observed on the west
side not far from the former, and forming part of the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
elevated platform, had horizontal holes, and lay on a solid
mass of wood, stones, and vegetable matter, which was interposed
between it and the rude log pavement (the rectangular
oak pavement did not extend so far). Fig. 40 is a view
taken from about the middle of the bank, close to the south
side of the log pavement, and looking north-west. In front
are seen the remains of a partition, a little farther back the
beam just described, and turning round, at the far-off corner,
the beam represented in Fig. 41. Fig. 42 is also taken from
the same point, but with the view looking north-east. In
both these sketches portions of the oak pavement are seen
before any of the logs were disturbed. All the raised beams
found in position were from 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> to 3 feet above the log pavement,
and were directed towards the centre of the crannog,
so that they presented an appearance which reminded one of
the spokes of a large wheel. On the north side this arrangement
was very well marked, many of the beams being still
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in situ</i>, and in one place long beams were found lying over
them, and running along the circumference of the crannog,
above which were distinctly seen remains of a wooden platform
precisely similar to that already described, at the north-east
corner, with which, indeed, it was continuous.</p>

<p>It is thus more than probable that a circular platform of
wood, presenting a breastwork some 3 feet high, surrounded
the central log pavement, except at its southern side, where
no traces of the raised horizontal beams were found, and
where also the uprights were mostly formed of thick boards,
suggesting rather the idea of a division between the wooden
pavement and the refuse-bed. On the west side the segment
left between the side of the rectangular oak pavement
was also covered with logs of wood, but much rougher, and
made of a softer wood than oak. This ruder pavement
extended below the transverse beams, and merged into a
conglomerated mass of stones, brushwood, and beams.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>External to this circle of piles and platform, at the sides,
but more especially on the south, there were other piles
which appeared to form circles. On the south side indications
of two or three such circles were noticed, but on the
north side we could not ascertain their extent, as the trench
was not far enough out to expose them if they did exist.
But this point, together with several others, we hope to
determine by further excavations as soon as the weather
permits.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 43.&mdash;Portions of Iron Saw (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>).</p></div>
</div>

<p>About 25 yards south of the crannog I observed a row of
stakes in an open drain running towards the nearest land,
and the tops of others in the grass, which from their arrangement
suggested the idea that they were part of a gangway
which formerly extended between it and the shore. This is
one of those points not examined when our operations were
interrupted by the severity of the weather.</p>

<p>The principal relics found beyond the inner circle row<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
of piles consist of portions of a metal saw (Fig. 43), three
flint implements (Figs. 63, 64, and 65), and two bundles of
the fringe-like apparatus made of moss, besides those found
in the refuse-bed.</p>

<p>2. <em>Refuse-Bed.</em>&mdash;The refuse-bed lay at the south-east side
of the crannog (see Plan), just at the corner of the central
log pavement, and consisted chiefly of gritty ash, decayed
bones, and vegetable matters. It extended from the inner
circle of stockades to within a few feet of the outer trench.
Its breadth would be about 10 or 12 feet, and its length
from east to west nearly double that. Its surface was from
3 to 4 feet below that of the field, so that its average depth
would not be much short of 3 feet. Some important relics
were found here, such as metal instruments and daggers,
two fibulæ, several wooden vessels, and a few bone implements.
It is noteworthy that the metal objects were all
comparatively near the surface of the midden, and also that
no boars' tusks or teeth were found in it except at its very
lowest stratum.</p>

<p>It was ascertained, through the careful inspection of the
Rev. Mr. Landsborough, that some of the large bones, especially
leg-bones, contained in their cavities and interstices
beautiful green crystals, of which I have collected some fine
specimens. According to the analysis of Mr. John Borland,
F.C.S., F.R.M.S., they are Vivianite, regarding which he
writes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<em>Vivianite.</em>&mdash;A phosphate of iron, of somewhat definite composition,
arising from the varying degree of oxidation of its base
and state of hydration.</p>

<p>"It is found in two conditions&mdash;Amorphous and Crystalline&mdash;the
former not uncommon, the latter rare. The amorphous has
been frequently described under the name of blue iron earth; the
crystalline was first named, and its relationship to the amorphous
pointed out, by Weiner in Hoffmann's <cite>Mineralogie</cite>, about the year
1818 or 1820; the name being given in compliment to a Mr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>.
Vivian of Cornwall, whose attention was first directed to the
mineral.</p>

<p>"It has also been found at Bodenmais in Berne, and in several
localities in America.</p>

<p>"Bischoff, in his <cite>Elements of Chemical and Physical Geology</cite>, as
translated for the Cavendish Society, vol. ii. page 35, refers to a
paper communicated by Von Carnall to a meeting of the Niederrheinischen
Gesellschaft at Bonn, on the 3d December 1846,
wherein mention is made of a remarkable instance of the occurrence
of this mineral in the Scharley calamine mine, Silesia,
which it was presumed was originally worked for lead.</p>

<p>"At a depth of 8 or 9 fathoms the skeleton of a man was
found, and on breaking one of the bones crystals of vivianite
became visible in the interior. A thigh-bone, when sawn
through, showed crystals projecting from the inner surface, and
others which were loose. The length of time the bones had lain
there was unknown. The working of the Scharley mine began
in the thirteenth century, and at the date of the communication
had been discontinued for nearly three hundred years.</p>

<p>"Bischoff, however, advances the suggestion that, as the shaft
may have been sunk in search of calamine, and not for the working
of the lead, the age of the bones would not be so great as
might at first be assumed. An analysis of the few crystals placed
at my disposal leads to the conclusion that their constitution may
be represented by the formula</p>

<p class="center">3FeO.P²O⁵ + Fe²O³.PO⁵ + 15 aq.<br /></p>

<p>"They belong to the monoclinic system of crystallography, and are
of greenish-blue colour, becoming darker gradually on exposure
to air."</p></blockquote>

<p>In several places, when digging below the level of the
log pavement and thrusting a staff a few feet downwards,
gas bubbled up through the water, which, on applying a
lighted match, ignited with considerable explosion. This,
on analysis, was found to be carburetted hydrogen or marsh
gas, with a small quantity of carbonic acid gas.</p>

<p>Before the stuff inside the circular trench was completely
cleared away down to the level of the log pavement, our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
operations had to be abandoned on account of the severity of
the weather. Meantime I drew up the above report from a
careful journal kept of each day's proceedings and finds, and
at the March meeting communicated it to the Society of
Antiquaries of Scotland. But, notwithstanding the great
variety of relics discovered, and the important information
regarding the general structure of the crannog which had
been ascertained, there were still several points requiring
further elucidation. Of these the following four were the
chief, which may be thus succinctly stated:&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Firstly.</em>&mdash;From a perusal of the Plan (Plate II.) it will be
observed that at the south side there is at least one well-marked
circular group of upright piles external to the one
surrounding the log pavement; hence the question which
pressed for solution was&mdash;Whether these groups merged into
the one on the north side, or whether there was another
corresponding to the former still further out?</p>

<p><em>Secondly.</em>&mdash;It was obvious that the island extended considerably
beyond our original circular trench, so that a
correct estimate of it could not be formed from our present
data.</p>

<p><em>Thirdly.</em>&mdash;We had no reliable information regarding the
composition of the island below the log pavement, as deeper
digging could not be carried on to any extent without a
pump, owing to the accumulation of water&mdash;the main drain
being nearly on a level with it.</p>

<p><em>Fourthly.</em>&mdash;The supposed gangway had to be examined.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As none of the above problems could be solved without
additional excavations, it was clear that, in the interests of
science, the work should be resumed. But here occurred a
difficulty. As the drainage operations conducted on the
farm of Lochlee had now come to a close, and the workmen
were removed elsewhere, Mr. Turner gave instructions that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
no further outlay should be incurred in the investigation of
the crannog; and as, moreover, his Grace the late Duke of
Portland, in answer to petitions from the Town Council and
Philosophical Society of Kilmarnock, had given all the relics
to the Corporation of this town, we felt it incumbent on us
to restrict applications for more funds to carry on the explorations
to the local authorities who had thus, without any
expenditure whatever, become the owners of a rare and
valuable collection of archæological relics. But the only
result of our representation was a grant of £10 from the
Philosophical Society; which, however, under the judicious
management of Mr. Blackwood, together with a few private
contributions kindly given by Messrs. James Blackwood,
James Craig, Charles Reid, and Thomas Kennedy, enabled
us to bring the work to a tolerably satisfactory conclusion.</p>

<p>Upon resuming operations in the month of April we
directed the workmen to clear away the soil at the north-west
corner, where, it will be remembered, two mortised
beams were exposed in the original circular trench. These
were then supposed to be part of the well-defined circle
running along the north side, but now, however, they were
found to be from 8 to 10 feet external to this circle. Upon
careful inspection of the wooden structures at the north-east
corner, we found that the inner termination of the platform,
conterminous with the elaborate mortised beams at the outer
trench, was supported by transverse mortised beams similar
to those in the general circle&mdash;one of which is figured in Fig.
41. There could, indeed, be hardly any doubt that at this
corner two circular rows of uprights with their transverses
gradually merged into one on the north. Hence it became
a very feasible supposition that those mortised beams at the
north-west corresponded with the outer ones at the north-east
side, and formed part of an outer circle which also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
merged into the one on the north. But upon extending
excavations so as to expose them completely, this supposition
was not borne out. They were in a slanting position, about
15 feet apart, and their outer ends on a level with the log
pavement. Half-way between them there was another beam
lying in a similar position, but it contained no mortised
holes. Their lower or outer extremities were jammed against
a sort of network of logs, some running along the circumference
and others slanting rapidly downwards, while their
inner ends were raised about 2 feet and rested on a mass of
stones and logs of wood. The outer hole of the beam,
marked <span class="smcap">H</span> on the Plan, contained a portion of an upright,
which had, however, more the appearance of being used as a
peg to keep it down. The other mortised holes appeared to
be of no use whatever, so that these beams were intended
for, and probably served, a different purpose before being
placed in their present position.</p>

<p>It was now evident that the margin of the crannog was
near, as at the upper or surface portions of the trenches we
encountered a layer of fatty clay, which had undoubtedly
been deposited by the surrounding lake. This layer
gradually got thicker as we advanced outwards, and the
dark vegetable débris and wood-work, forming the substance
of the island, shelved downwards underneath it. A foot or
two beyond the outer end of the beam <span class="smcap">G</span>, this clay was 3 feet
6 inches thick. Pursuing our investigations northwards
towards the point <span class="smcap">A</span> (Plan Plate II.), we came upon a dense
wooden structure formed of stakes, logs, planks, and brushwood,
woven together in the most fantastic fashion, which
also shelved downwards below the clay. At the point <span class="smcap">A</span>
this clay was no less than six feet deep. Here the water
oozed up, but there was no doubt, from the above appearances
and the rapidly slanting wood-work,&mdash;some stakes
now running downwards and outwards at an angle of about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
45°,&mdash;that we had reached the sloping margin of the island.
Imbedded in the clay near the point <span class="smcap">A</span> were found two
pieces of charred stakes, one 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> feet and the other nearly
6 feet deep. About half-way between the margin of the
crannog and the circle of stakes surrounding the log pavement,
and 5 feet deep, the workmen discovered, amongst
decayed brushwood and chips of wood, a beautiful trough
cut out of a single block of wood. It was quite whole when
found, and showed very distinctly the markings of the
gouge-like instrument by which it was fashioned. It was
made of soft wood, which, upon drying, quickly crumbled
into dust, but Fig. 44, engraved from a photograph taken by
Mr. Blackwood soon after its discovery, gives a very good
idea of it.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 45.&mdash;Wooden Board (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>).</p></div>
</div>

<p>Instead of pursuing the excavations further in this direction,
our means being quite inadequate to clear away the
soil at a uniform breadth of about 20 feet all round, we
resolved to form a number of cuttings projecting outwards,
at suitable intervals, from the circumference of the space
already cleared. These cuttings (see Plan, <span class="smcap">a</span>, <span class="smcap">b</span>, <span class="smcap">c</span>, <span class="smcap">d</span> and <span class="smcap">e</span>)
varied from 10 to 20 feet in breadth, and extended outwards
in each case till we were satisfied, from the encroachment of
the surrounding clay, that the margin of the crannog had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
been reached. On the north and north-east trenches the
wood-work assumed a most extraordinarily intricate arrangement.
It consisted mostly of young trees and branches of
birch, the bark of which was quite fresh-like, and distinctly
recognisable, mixed with stakes and logs, some of oak, running
in all conceivable directions, and constituting a protective
barrier,&mdash;proof, I should say, against the most violent
action of both wind and water. At its inner side, close to
the original circular trench, this peculiar structure, which
we called trestle-work, was only about 18 inches below the
surface, but sloped downwards, at first gradually, and then
rapidly, till it disappeared under the clay. At the north-east
corner it extended about 20 feet beyond the group of
mortised beams, so that the latter could not have been a
landing-stage, a theory which was long current amongst the
quidnuncs. Near the outer edge of the cutting at this
corner (<span class="smcap">c</span>), there was observed, mixed up with the trestle-work,
an oak beam, having two square mortised holes, which
must have been originally adapted for a higher purpose than
the humble function of packing, which it here served.
Lying over the wood-work, and less than two feet below the
surface, I picked up portions of a leather boot or shoe, with
fragments of a leather lace, crossed diagonally, which had
tied it in front; also a small wooden stave like that of a
milk-cog. Deeper, and near the outer edge, the workmen
found a much corroded dagger or spear head. At the south<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>-east
corner (<span class="smcap">d</span>), a series of upright piles with the remains of a
transverse was exposed, but the trestling work had dwindled
down to mere brushwood, with an occasional beam mixed
up with it. Here the workmen found a thin board made
of hard wood, resembling a portion of the end of a small
barrel, with diagonal and other markings lightly cut upon it
(Fig. 45).</p>

<p>On the south side, external to the refuse-bed, quite a
forest of piles was encountered, together with the charred
remains of a few mortised transverses and some long beams.
From a glance at the Plan it will be observed that, at the cutting
<span class="smcap">e</span>, the outer circle of these uprights curves outwards as if
to meet the line of the supposed gangway. It would have
been more satisfactory if a larger portion had been here cleared
away, and the junction of the gangway with the crannog more
accurately determined; but at this particular spot there was
such an immense accumulation of rubbish, formerly wheeled
from the interior of the mound, that the labour of removing
it was too great. The superficial layer of fatty clay appeared
here also, and at the point <span class="smcap">e</span> measured 2 feet 3 inches in
thickness. The horizontal beams found at this side, some
of which were indicated on the Plan, were from 4 to 5 feet
deep, and about the same level some important relics were
dug up. Near the point <span class="smcap">m</span> were found a bridle bit (Fig.
148), a bronze dagger-like instrument (Fig. 145), and a four-plied
plaited object made of the long stems of a moss similar
to those of which the fringe-like article was manufactured,
and referred to on a former occasion. It had the tapering
appearance of a cue or pigtail; and measured 17 inches
long and about 2 broad in the middle. Near it, and about
5 feet deep, an iron hatchet (Fig. 46), much corroded, but
still retaining a small bit of the wooden handle, was discovered
by one of the workmen. A few feet to the east of
this, and lying across the line of the gangway, a large oar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
was exposed to view. It was quite whole when found, but
being made of soft wood, was so fragile that it broke into
pieces in the act of removal. Its extreme length was 9<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> feet,
and the blade measured 3 feet by 14 inches. The round
handle was perforated about its middle by two small holes
a couple of inches apart.</p>

</div>

<p>We made no projecting trench on the south-west side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
owing to the proximity of a network of recent drains, which,
if disturbed, might injuriously interfere with the drainage of
the field, but from the general appearance of the wood-work
we were satisfied that this portion was symmetrical with the
rest of the crannog. The ends of flat beams jutted out at
the bottom of the cutting immediately on the west side,
which clearly indicated a parallelism with the three exposed
a little farther north; and towards the south one or two
uprights belonging to the outer series were visible.</p>

<p>Having now collected the chief facts regarding the log
pavement, its surrounding and superincumbent structures,
and the extent of the crannog, we determined to sink a
shaft at the lower end of the log pavement&mdash;<em>i.e.</em> about the
centre of the crannog&mdash;for the purpose of ascertaining, if
possible, the thickness, composition, and mode of structure
of the island itself. This shaft was rectangular in form, and
large enough to allow three men to work in it together.
After removing the three or four layers of oak planks which
constituted the log pavement, we came upon a thin layer of
brushwood and then large trunks of trees laid in regular beds
or layers, each layer having its logs lying parallel to each
other, but transversely and sometimes obliquely to those of
the layer immediately above or below it. At the west end
of the trench, after removing the first and second layers of
the log pavement, we found part of a small canoe hollowed
out of an oak trunk. This portion was 5 feet long, 12 inches
deep, and 14 inches broad at the stern, but widened towards
the broken end, where its breadth was 19 inches. This was
evidently part of an old worn-out canoe, thus economised,
and used instead of a prepared log. Much progress in this
kind of excavation was by no means an easy task, as it was
necessary to keep two men constantly pumping the water
which copiously flowed from all directions into the trench,
and even then there always remained some at the bottom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
As we advanced downwards we encountered layer upon
layer of the trunks of trees with the branches closely chopped
off, and so soft that the spade easily cut through them.
Birch was the prevailing kind of wood, but occasionally
beams of oak were found, with holes at their extremities,
through which pins of oak penetrated into other holes in the
logs beneath. One such pin, some 3 or 4 inches in diameter,
was found to pass through no less than four beams in successive
layers, and to terminate ultimately in a round trunk
over 13 inches in diameter. One of the oak beams was
extracted entire, and measured 8 feet 3 inches in length
and 10 inches in breadth, and the holes in it were 5 feet
apart. Others were found to have small round projections,
which evidently fitted into mortised holes in adjacent
beams.</p>

<p>Down to a depth of about 4 feet the logs were rudely
split, but below this they appeared to be round rough trunks,
with the bark still adhering to them. Their average diameter
would be from 6 inches to 1 foot, and amongst them
were some curiously gnarled stems occasionally displaying
large knotty protuberances. Of course the wood in the act
of digging the trench was cut up into fragments, and, on
being uncovered, its tissues had a natural and even fresh-like
appearance, but in a few minutes after exposure to the
air they became as black as ink. Amongst the débris thrown
up from a depth of 6 feet below the log pavement I picked
up the larger portion of a broken hammer-stone or polisher,
which, from the worn appearance presented by its fractured
edges, must have been used subsequently to its breakage.
After a long and hard day's work we reached a depth of
7 feet 4 inches, but yet there were no indications of
approaching the bottom of this subaqueous fabric. However,
towards the close of the second day's labour, when
the probability of total discomfiture in reaching the bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
was freely talked of, our most energetic foreman announced,
after cutting through a large flat trunk 14 inches thick, that
underneath this he could find no trace of further wood-work.
The substance removed from below the lowest logs consisted
of a few twigs of hazel brushwood, imbedded in a dark, firm,
but friable and somewhat peaty soil, which we concluded to
be the silt of the lake deposited before the foundations of
the crannog were laid. The depth of this solid mass of
wood-work, measuring from the surface of the log pavement,
was 9 feet 10 inches, or about 16 feet from the surface of
the field.</p>

<p>Amongst the very last spadefuls pitched from this depth
was found nearly one-half of a well-formed and polished
ring made out of shale, the external and internal diameters
of which were 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> and 2 inches respectively.</p>

<p><em>Gangway.</em>&mdash;The probable existence of some kind of communication
between the crannog and the shore of the lake
was suggested at a very early stage of these investigations
by the discovery of a few oak piles in a drain outside the
mound, and to clear up this mystery was now the only
problem of importance that remained to be solved. We
commenced this inquiry by excavating a rectangular space,
30 feet long, 16 feet broad, and 3 to 4 feet deep, in the line
of direction indicated by the piles (marked <span class="smcap">O</span> on the Plan),
and exposed quite a forest of oak stakes. Other trenches,
marked <span class="smcap">P</span> and <span class="smcap">Q</span> respectively, were then made with exactly
similar results. The stakes thus revealed did not at first
appear to conform to any systematic arrangement, but by
and by we detected, in addition to single piles, small groups
of three, four, and five, here and there at short intervals.
This observation, however, conveyed little or no meaning, so
that we could form no opinion as to the manner in which
they were used. No trace of mortised beams was anywhere
to be seen. In all the trenches the stuff dug up was of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
same character. First or uppermost there was a bed of fine
clay rather more than 2 feet thick, and then a soft dark
substance formed of decomposed vegetable matters. The
source of the latter was evident from the occurrence in its
upper stratum of large quantities of leaves, some stems,
branches, and the roots of stunted trees, apparently <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in situ</i>.
The tops of the piles in the trench <span class="smcap">q</span> were from 2 to 3 feet
below the surface of the field, but they appeared to rise
gradually as we receded from the crannog, and in the trench
next the shore one or two were found on a level with the
grass. About 4 feet deep the stuff at the bottom of the
trench was so soft that a man could scarcely stand on it
without sinking ankle-deep. It was not nearly so heavy
as ordinary soil, but more adhesive, and of a nutty brown
colour, which, on exposure, quickly turned dark. Notwithstanding
the flabbiness of this material, the piles felt quite
firm, and this fact, together with the experience derived
from our examination of the deeper structures of the island,
led to the supposition that the piles would be found to terminate
in some more solid basis than had yet been made
apparent. To remove all doubts on this point, though a
long iron rod could be easily pushed downwards without
meeting any resistance, we ordered a large deep shaft to be
dug in the line of the piles, and the cutting <span class="smcap">q</span>, being nearest
the crannog, was selected for this purpose. This was accomplished
with much difficulty, but we were amply rewarded
by coming upon an elaborate system of wood-work, which I
found no less difficult to comprehend than it now is to
describe. The first horizontal beam was reached about 7 feet
deep, and for other 3 feet we passed through a complete network
of similar beams, lying in various directions. Below
this, <em>i.e.</em> 10 feet from the surface, the workmen could find
no more beams, and the lake silt became harder and more
friable. We then cleared a larger area so as to exhibit the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
structural arrangement of the wood-work. The reason of
grouping the piles now became apparent. The groups were
placed in a somewhat zigzag fashion near the sides of the
gangway, and from each there radiated a series of horizontal
beams, the ends of which crossed each other and were kept
in position by the uprights. One group was carefully inspected.
The first or lowest beam observed was right across,
the next lay lengthways and of course at right angles to the
former, then three or four spread out diagonally, like a fan,
and terminated in other groups at the opposite side of the
gangway, and lastly, one again lay lengthways. (See Plan
and Sections.) Thus each beam raised the level of the
general structure the exact height of its thickness, though
large lozenge-shaped spaces remained in the middle quite
clear of any beams. The general breadth of the portion of
this unique structure examined was about 10 feet (but an
isolated pile was noticed farther out), and its thickness
varied from 3 to 4 feet. A large oak plank, some 10 feet
long, showing the marks of a sharp cutting instrument by
which it was formed, was found lying on edge at its west
side, and beyond the line of piles, but otherwise no remains
of a platform were seen. All the beams and stakes were
made of oak, and so thoroughly bound together that, though
not a single joint, mortise, or pin was discovered, the whole
fabric was as firm as a rock. No relics were found in any
of the excavations along the line of this gangway.</p>


<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">Relics.</span></p>

<p>The remains of human industry found during the excavations
of the Lochlee Crannog, calculated to throw light
on the civilisation and social economy of its occupiers, are
very abundant. They comprise a large variety of objects,
such as warlike weapons, industrial implements, and personal
ornaments, made of stone, bone, horn, wood, metal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
etc. In the following description of them I have adopted,
as perhaps the most convenient, the principle of classification
suggested by the materials of which they are composed.</p>


<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">I. Objects made of Stone.</span></p>

</div>

<p><em>Hammer-Stones.</em>&mdash;A great many water-worn pebbles, of
a similar character to those found in the surrounding glacial
drift and river-courses, which were used as hammers, or
pounders, or rubbers, were discovered in the débris all over
the crannog, but more abundantly in the deeper layers of a
small circular area round the hearths, corresponding to what
I have on a former occasion designated the relic-bed. As
typical specimens of such implements I have collected no
less than nineteen. Of these, fourteen are of a somewhat
elongated oval shape, and were used at one or both ends.
They vary considerably in size, the major diameter of the
largest measuring 6 inches, and the rest graduating downwards
to about the half of this. Two are flat and circular,
and show friction-markings all round; while other three
show signs of having been used on their flat surfaces only.
The one represented in Fig. 48, with markings on its flat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
sides, is divided into two portions, each of which was picked
up separately, about a yard asunder, and found to fit exactly.
It would thus appear that it was broken while being used
on the crannog, and then pitched aside as useless. Some
are slightly chipped at one end, others have small finger-like
depressions, as if intended to give the user a better grip
(Figs. 49, 50, and 51).</p>

<p><em>Heating-Stones and Sling-Stones.</em>&mdash;A large number of
round stones, varying in size from half an inch to three
inches in diameter, some having their surfaces roughened
and cracked as if by fire, but others presenting no marks
whatever, were met with. The former might have been used
as heating-stones for boiling water in wooden vessels,&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
only ones found on the crannog,&mdash;the latter as sling-stones
or missiles.</p>

<p><em>Anvil.</em>&mdash;About a foot below the surface, and a few feet
to the north of the upper fireplace, a beautiful quartz pebble
was found by Mr. Cochran-Patrick, which has the appearance
of being used as an anvil. It is discoidal in shape, but
a little more rounded on its upper surface, and measures 27
inches in circumference. It is just such an instrument as a
shoemaker of the present day would gladly pick up for
hammering leather (see Fig. 37).</p>

<p>Sharpening-Stones (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>).</p></div>
</div>

<p><em>Sharpening-Stones or Whetstones.</em>&mdash;Four or five whetstones
were collected from various parts of the island, three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
of which are here engraved (Figs. 52, 53, and 54). They are
made of a hard smooth claystone, one only being made of a
fine-grained sandstone, and vary in length from 5 to 7 inches.
Fig. 54 represents what is supposed to be a hone 6<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inches
long, and containing a smooth groove. It was found on the
site of the crannog by Captain Gillon, long after the explorations
had been brought to a close, and is now deposited in
the National Museum (see page 126).</p>

<p>Besides these <em>hones</em> we noticed a large block of a coarse
sandstone, having one side covered with deep ruts, supposed
to be caused by the sharpening of pointed instruments.</p>

<p><em>Polished Celt.</em>&mdash;Only one polished stone celt was found.
It is a wedge-shaped instrument, 5<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches long, and 2
broad along its cutting edge, which bears the evidence of
having been well used, and tapers gently towards the other
end, which is round and blunt. It is made of a hard
mottled greenstone (Fig. 55).</p>

<p><em>Circular Stone.</em>&mdash;Fig. 56 represents a peculiar circular
implement manufactured out of a bit of hard trap rock.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
It presents two flat surfaces, 3 inches in diameter, with a
round periphery, and is 1-3/8 inch thick.</p>

<p><em>Querns.</em>&mdash;Five upper, and portions of several lower,
quern-stones were disinterred at different periods during
these excavations, all of which, however&mdash;with the exception
of the pair found over the log pavement, and an upper stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
observed towards the west margin of the crannog, but of
which I could find no definite information, as it was stolen soon
afterwards,&mdash;were imbedded in the débris not far from the site
of the fireplaces, and superficial to the level of the middle or
first-discovered pavement. Some are made of granite, while others
appear to be made of schist or hard whinstone. Besides the central
cup-shaped hole, which, of course, all the upper ones possess, one
has a second hole slanting slightly inwards, another has a similar
hole, but only half-way through, while a third has no second hole at
all, and a fourth shows a horizontal depression at its side. The one
without a second hole on its surface is nearly circular, but the others
are all more or less elongated. Their largest diameters vary from 13
to 14 inches. One is broken into three portions, which, though dug up
separately, fit exactly. It measures 14 inches by 11, and the central
hole is wide, being no less than 5 inches across. From the upper edge
of this hopper-like cavity the stone slopes gently all round to the
circumference of its under surface, and the second hole completely
perforates it.</p>

<p><em>Cup-marked Stones.</em>&mdash;Two portions of red sandstone,
having cup-shaped cavities about 1 inch deep and 3 inches
diameter, were found amongst the débris. One of them
was lying underneath a horizontal raised beam at the north
side of the crannog. The position of the other was not
determined. The latter has two circular depressions or
grooves round the cup, the outer of which is about 9 inches
in diameter (Figs. 60 and 61).</p>

<p><em>Other Stone Relics.</em>&mdash;Besides the above there are a few
other articles of stone bearing the evidence of design, which
I must just allude to.</p>

<p>1. A large stone having a deep groove all round about
it, as if intended for a rope. The larger portion of this
groove was caused by atmospheric agencies, and only one
side could be positively stated to have been artificially
formed.</p>

<p>2. A thin oval-shaped disc of a light black substance
like shale, measuring 3 inches by 2 inches.</p>

<p>3. Portion of a polished stone 2 inches long, having a
narrow groove surrounding one end, and through which it
appears to have been broken (Fig. 62).</p>

<p><em>Flint Implements.</em>&mdash;Only three flint objects have been
discovered on the crannog.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>1. A beautifully chipped horseshoe-shaped scraper, found
at north-east corner, on a level with the raised wooden
platform. It is made of a whitish flint, and measures 1 inch
in length by 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in breadth (Fig. 63).</p>

<p>2. A large knife-flake, 3 inches long and 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> broad, which
appears to have been much used at the edges and point. It
is also made of a whitish flint, and presents three smooth
surfaces above and one below (Fig. 64).</p>

(Fig. 65).</p>

<p><em>Spindle Whorls.</em>&mdash;Three small circular objects, supposed
to be spindle whorls, are here classed together. Two are
made of clay, and were found in the relic-bed near the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
fireplaces. The smaller of the two is 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inch in diameter,
and has a small round hole in the centre; the other has
a diameter of 1<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inch, but is only partially perforated, just
sufficient to indicate that the act of perforation had been
commenced but not completed (Figs. 66 and 67). The third
object is a smooth, flat, circular bit of stone, 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inch in
diameter and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> an inch
thick, and is perforated in
the centre like a large bead
(Fig. 68).</p>

<p>Bone Chisels (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>).</p></div>
</div>

<p>Upwards of twenty implements made of bone have been
added to the general collection, all of which were found
either in the relic-bed or refuse-heap.
The following are the most interesting:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Two Chisels or Spatulæ. One
(Fig. 69) is made of a split portion of
a shank-bone, and measures 5<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inches
long and rather less than <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> an inch
broad. It is very hard, flat, and smoothly
ground at one end, and has a sharp
rounded edge, which extends further on
the left side, thus indicating that it was
adapted for being used by the right
hand. The other (Fig. 70) is a small
leg-bone obliquely cut so as to present
a smooth polished surface. Its length
is 4 inches and diameter <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inch.</p>

<p>Bone Implements (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>).</p></div>
</div>

<p>2. Five small objects presenting cut
and polished surfaces, three of which are sharp and pointed
(Figs. 71, 74, 75); one (Fig. 72) appears to have been notched
at the end and there broken off; and the last (Fig. 73)
presenting well-cut facets, is fashioned into a neat little wedge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>3. Fig. 76 represents a tiny little spoon only <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of an
inch in diameter, and worn into a hole in its centre. The
handle portion is round and straight, and proportionally
small, being only two inches long and about the diameter of
a crow-quill. Fig. 77 shows another portion of bone somewhat
spoon-shaped.</p>

<p>4. Fig. 78 is a drawing of a neatly formed needle-like
instrument. It is flat on both sides, finely polished, and
gradually tapering into points at its extremities. The eye
is near its middle, being two inches from one end and 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
inch from the other, and large enough for strong twine to
pass through it.</p>

<p>5. Fig. 79 is a drawing of a portion of bone artificially
made into a sharp-pointed instrument. Several similar
objects were met with, but as they showed no distinct workmanship
I have not preserved them.</p>

<p>6. A great many small ribs, about 6 or 7 inches in length,
and portions of others, were found to have the marks of a
sharp cutting instrument by which they were pointed and
smoothed along their edges, the use of which can only be
conjectured. Figs. 80 to 82 are drawings of some of them.
Fig. 83 shows a larger rib-bone, highly polished all over and
notched round one end.</p>

which appeared to have been used as handles for knives or
suchlike instruments.</p>

<p>Out of about forty portions of horn, chiefly of the red
deer, bearing evidence of human workmanship, I have
selected for illustration sixteen of the most characteristic
specimens. Two hammers or clubs, formed from the lower
portions of the beam antlers of stags by cutting or sawing off
their branches. One (Fig. 84) is 11 inches long, and has
about three inches of the brow branch of the horn projecting
from it, round the root of which there is a groove as if
intended for a string. The markings on the back portion
indicate very distinctly that it was used for hammering
some hard substance. Fig. 85 is a still more formidable
weapon, being 14 inches long and 9 inches in circumference
near the burr. Portion of the latter is worn completely
away by use. Fig. 86 is the root portion of a large antler,
having one surface made smooth, and containing two circular
depressions and a few deeply penetrating marks as if made
by a sharp instrument. Fig. 87 is a portion of a horn with
a groove round one end. Figs. 88, 89, 90 represent split
portions of horn sharpened at the point like daggers. Figs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
91, 92, 93 are three pointed portions or tines, two of which
were probably used as spear-heads, and contain small holes at the cut
ends by which they were fastened on handles. Fig. 94 represents portion
of horn (roe) cut at both ends with a hole near its centre, which,
however, does not pass through; while Fig. 95 shows another small
pointed and curved portion, with a hole, about 1 inch from the end,
passing completely through it. Fig. 96 was evidently used as a hook, as
the stem portion is smoothly bored and made suitable for a handle. Fig.
97 is a small portion made into a ring. The last object figured under
this head is a <em>bodkin</em> 8 inches long, finely polished all over,
and pointed at the tip as if with a sharp knife. The other end, which
is large and circular, is pierced by a round hole, by means of which it
might have been strung to one's person (Fig. 99). The portions of horns
not figured consist of clubs, pointed tines, short thick pieces, etc.,
all of which show the marks of tools upon them.</p>

<p>Besides the above there are a great many fragments of
horns, some of which, as mentioned by Professor Rolleston
in his report on the fauna, might have been used as implements.
One of the fragments labelled by this gentleman as
being part of the horn of a reindeer, is a short flat tine, and
bears the evidence of having been sawn off. It is 6 inches
long and 2 broad at the base.</p>


<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">IV. Objects of Wood.</span></p>

<p>A large assortment of wooden implements was found
chiefly in the refuse-heap, and in the portion of débris
corresponding to the area of the log pavement. Owing to
the softness of the wood and the large amount of moisture
contained in its fibres, most of these relics have already
shrunk to less than half their original bulk, and become so
changed, though they were kept in a solution of alum for
several weeks, that I am doubtful of being able to preserve
them at all. Seeing the rapid decay they were undergoing,
I got full-sized pencil-drawings taken of them, from which
the accompanying illustrations have been engraved. They
consist of bowls, plates, ladles, a mallet, a hoe, clubs, pins,
etc., together with many objects entirely new to me, but
which apparently had been used for culinary or agricultural
purposes.</p>

<p>4. <em>Canoes, Paddles, etc.</em>&mdash;At the
commencement of our explorations, as
already mentioned, a canoe, hollowed
out of a single oak trunk, was found
about 100 yards north of the crannog.
Its depth in the moss was well ascertained,
owing to the fact that, though
lying at the bottom of one of the original
drains, it presented no obstruction to
the flow of water, and consequently was
then undisturbed. During the recent
drainage all the drains were made a
foot deeper, and hence its discovery.
It measures 10 feet long, 2 feet 6 inches
broad (inside), and 1 foot 9 inches
deep. The bottom is flat and 4 inches thick, but its sides are
thin and rise up abruptly. There are nine holes in its bottom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
arranged in two rows, and about 15 inches apart, with the odd
one at the apex. These holes are perfectly round, and exactly
1 inch in diameter, and when the canoe was disinterred they
were quite invisible, being all tightly plugged (Fig. 125).</p>

<p>The oak paddle here figured was found on the crannog.
It is double-bladed, 4 feet 8 inches long and 5<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches
broad (Fig. 126).</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 126.&mdash;Oak Paddle (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>24</sub>).</p></div>
</div>

<p>A large oar, together with the blade portion of another,
was found on the margin of the crannog, which has already
been described (see page 96).</p>

<p>When the original drainage was carried out some forty
years ago, I understand that two canoes, each of which was
about 12 feet long, were found in the bed of the lake on the
south-west side of the crannog.</p>


<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">V. Objects of Metal.</span></p>

<p>(<em>a.</em>) <em>Articles made of Iron.</em>&mdash;1. A gouge, 8 inches long;
stem 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inch in circumference, slightly fluted before and
behind; length of cutting edge <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of an inch; handle portion
contained beautiful green crystals of vivianite (Fig. 127).</p>

<p>2. A chisel, length 10 inches; handle portion 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches
long; contains crystals and small remnant of bone handle;
below handle there is a thick rim of iron; cutting edge
measures only <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> an inch, and slopes equally on both sides.
Top shows evidence of being hammered (Fig. 128).</p>

<p>3. Two knives. One (Fig. 129) has a blade 6 inches
long, and a pointed portion for being inserted into a handle;
found on a level with, and close to, the lowest hearth, along
with fragments of its handle made of stag's horn. The other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
(Fig. 47), found by a farmer in the débris long after it was
thrown out of the trenches, was hafted on a different plan
from the former, the end portion being broad and riveted
to its handle by four iron rivets, which still remain. The
blade is 6 inches long and much worn, being only <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
inch in breadth, and the handle portion is 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches long.
Its position in the crannog is therefore uncertain.</p>

a small portion of wood attached to one side (Fig. 137).</p>

<p>11. A saw, in three pieces, two of which were joined
when found, and the third was lying a few feet apart. The
length of the three portions together is 38 inches; average

<p>12. An iron shears, 6<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inches long (Fig. 138), was discovered
on the site of the crannog by Captain William
Gillon, 71st Highland Light Infantry, F.S.A. Scot. In presenting
this shears, along with the hone-stone (Fig. 54), to
the "National Collection," Captain Gillon thus describes
the circumstances which led him to its discovery: "Having
been in Ayrshire for the last five months, and within a short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
distance of Lochlee farm, I have had several opportunities
of visiting the site of the crannog, which was discovered
there in 1878, and has since proved so rich in relics....
Although the crannog had been filled up, I determined to
visit the site in the hope of finding some stray relic which
might have escaped the eye of former explorers. In February
1881, Mr. Drummond, farmer, Pockenave, went with
me, and as he had been present at the previous excavations,
he showed me the most likely place for a 'find.'</p>

<p>"After looking about for half an hour, I was lucky enough
to find the shears, which I forwarded to Professor Duns for
examination, as I did not observe any articles similar to this
in the Museum of Kilmarnock. On a subsequent occasion I
found the hone-stone. I did not notice any hone-stones
with a like groove in the Kilmarnock Museum, but on driving
out to the crannog which is being excavated at Buston,
near Kilmaurs, Dr. Munro showed me one which was of the
same nature as the one I had found, only the groove was
shorter and across the stone, and it had in addition a 'cupped
hollow' in the centre, while this one has the groove lengthways."

<p>13. Fig. 46 (p. 96) represents portion of a much corroded
hatchet, about 6 inches long and 2 broad immediately below
socket, but gets wider towards the cutting edge. Thickness
through centre of socket is 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inch. The back of socket
was round, and had no projecting portion. Total weight
12<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ounces. It had a small bit of the wooden handle in
the socket when found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

on its back were originally filled with enamel.</p>

<p>2. A bronze ring pin, 6 inches long. The square-shaped
portion at the top has a different device on each side, and
the shank from its middle to the point is ornamented on
both sides (Fig. 144).<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

</div>

<p>(<em>c.</em>) <em>Article made of Iron and Bronze.</em>&mdash;A bridle bit. This
consists of two large rings and a centre-piece. Its extreme
length is 10<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches, the outer diameter of the rings is rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
less than 3 inches, and the centre-piece, which is entirely
made of iron, is 3<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inches long. The rings are partly iron
and partly bronze, the circular portion being iron and the
rest bronze. The bronze portion is 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches long, and has
two eyes or loops, one of which is attached to the centre-piece
and the other free. This interesting relic was turned
up by two visitors poking with a stick at the south-east
corner of the refuse-heap (Fig. 148).</p>

<p>A round knob of lead, as if intended for the hilt of a hand
weapon, was found very near the surface of the mound.</p>


<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">VI. Miscellaneous Objects.</span></p>

<p>1. <em>Carved Wood.</em>&mdash;Perhaps the most interesting of all
the relics discovered on the crannog is a small piece of ash
wood, about 5 inches square, having curious diagrams carved
on both sides. On one side (Fig. 149), three equidistant
spiral grooves, with corresponding ridges between, start from
near a common centre and radiate outwards till they join, at
uniform distances, a common circle which surrounds the
diagram. On the other side (Fig. 150) is a similar diagram,
with this difference, that between the points of commencement
of the spiral grooves there is a space left which is
occupied by a small circular groove surrounding the central
depression or point. This figure is surmounted and overlapped
by two convoluted and symmetrical grooves meeting
each other in an elevated arch, with a small depression in its
centre. The relic was found on the west side of the crannog,
about 4 feet deep, and near the line of the horizontal raised
beams.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 149.&mdash;Carved Wood (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>).</p></div>
</div>

<p>2. <em>Fringe-like Objects.</em>&mdash;Another object which has excited
considerable curiosity is an apparatus made like a fringe by
simply plaiting together at one end the long stems of a kind
of moss (Fig. 151). Portions of similar articles were found
in three different parts of the crannog, and all deeply buried.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
The one figured here, and the most neatly formed, was found
in the relic-bed; another about a couple of yards north of the
fireplace, and others at the south-west side, a little external
to the area of the log pavement. In this latter place a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
quantity was found, but although the evidence of having
been plaited at one end was quite distinct, the stems of the
moss were not prepared with the same care as in the one
figured overleaf, as the leaflets were still adhering to them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
The cue or pigtail, described at page 95, seems to have been
formed of the same material as the so-called girdles or
fringes.</p>

</div>

<p>3. <em>Leather Objects.</em>&mdash;Fig. 152 is the representation of a
fragment of a curious object, consisting of two portions of
thick leather kept together by stout square-cut copper nails.
These nails are broader at one end than the other, and pass
completely through the layers of leather, after which they
appear to be slightly riveted. The relic, as it stands, contains
six nails, arranged in two rows, three in each row, and
measures 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> by 2 inches, but the marks of additional nails
are seen all round. Several portions of leather were collected
from time to time. On the occasion of Mr. Joseph Anderson's
visit to Lochlee, he found a shoe in the stuff just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
thrown out of the bottom of the outer trench at the south
side of the crannog. Other portions were picked up on the
surface of the trestle-work, showing marks of having been
neatly sewed. Also two stout thongs, one with a slit at the
end through which the other thong passed and then formed
a knot, together with a portion of coarse leather about the
size of the palm of my hand, were found near the junction
of the gangway with the crannog.</p>

portion of another similar to the former, but a little larger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>6. <em>Pottery.</em>&mdash;(1.) The bottom of a dish made of reddish
pottery, said to be Samian ware, was found in a drain close
to the crannog. Its diameter is 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches. (2.) Five small
portions of a whitish unglazed ware, with circular striæ, as
if made on the wheel, have been picked up in the débris
after it had been wheeled out and lain exposed to the
weather for some time, but the original situation of a single
bit has not been determined. These fragments might all
belong to the same vessel, and two of them, though found at
different parts and at different times, fit each other exactly.</p>

<p>7. <em>Crucible.</em>&mdash;A fragment of a small crucible coarsely
made, and not unlike that found at Dowalton (Fig. 15), was
for a long time mistaken for a bit of unglazed pottery. It
was found in the débris after it was wheeled out and had
lain exposed for a while.</p>

<p>Portions of Jet Armlets (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>).</p></div>
</div>

<p>8. <em>Lignite, Jet, etc.</em>&mdash;(1.) A small bit of a black substance
like a jet button. (2.) Two portions of armlets made of
lignite or jet, each about 2 inches long, were found near the
wooden platform at the north-east corner. One is a little
thicker and coarser than the other, and forms part of a
circle, which, if completed, would measure exactly 3 inches
across (internal diameter). The other is polished and of a
jet black colour, internal diameter 2<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inches. A third fragment
of a similar ornament was found in the débris when
closing up the crannog. It is more slender and has a
smaller diameter than either of the others. The portion of
ring made of shale found at the bottom of the deep shaft
below the log pavement is smaller than either of these,
its internal diameter being only 2 inches, and its external 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>
(Figs. 156 and 157).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>9. <em>Tusks.</em>&mdash;The large number of boars' tusks met with,
quite unconnected with the bones of the animal, especially
in the relic-bed around the fireplaces, suggests the idea that
they may have been used as implements. One only, however,
was found to have
decided marks of having been
formed into a tool. It is 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
inches long, and very sharply
pointed (Fig. 158).</p>

be a blue and a red pigment were found, but they were not
subjected to analysis. A specimen of the latter, which has
been kept in a bottle, is now turning blue like the former.</p>

<p>11. <em>Insect Cases.</em>&mdash;Large quantities of the horny coverings
of insects like beetles were found in patches here and there,
together with one or two brilliant-coloured <em>elytra</em>.</p>

<p>12. <em>Shell.</em>&mdash;One solitary shell was found near the fireplace,
which I believe to be <em>Littorina littorea</em>.</p>


<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">The Fauna of the Crannog.</span></p>

<p>The following is the report of Professor Rolleston, M.D.,
F.R.S., F.S.A., on the fauna of the crannog:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Among the bones submitted to me by Robert Munro,
M.D., Kilmarnock, and reported as having been procured
from a crannog at Lochlee, the following animals have their
skeletons represented:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Ox, <em>Bos longifrons</em>: no proof of the presence of the
wild variety.</p>

<p>"The Pig, <em>Sus scrofa</em>, variety <em>domestica</em>. I am not clear
that the wild variety is represented here any more than in
the specimens of the preceding species. (One fragment
might have belonged to a wild individual, the molar No. 3
in it having all the pinnacles and eminences which have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
given to the teeth of the <em>Suidæ</em>, as to the whole division of
non-ruminant Artiodactyles, the name Bunodont, worn away,
and having its grinding surface consequently reduced to one
single, however sinuous, continent of dentine bounded by
enamel.) As is well known,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> the bones of an ill-tended and
ill-fed self-providing, so-called domestic pig, come to be very
like the bones of a thoroughly wild pig; whilst, on the other
hand, it is also well known that very great variations exist
as to size within the limits even of the wild varieties of <em>Sus
scrofa</em>. But in the series now before me there is only one
fragment, consisting of the part of the lower jaw which
carries the last molar, and a part of the ascending ramus,
and of that last molar itself, which could, I think, by any
possibility be referred to the wild variety. And even here
such a reference could only be justified on the ground of the
great degradation which the cusps of the tooth have suffered,
it being usually the case that domestic pigs are not allowed
to live sufficiently long to get their teeth so worn down. I
have however to say that, both from this country and from
India, skulls of undoubtedly domestic animals of this species
have come into my hands, in which the teeth are worn down
far below the limits to which the molars of pigs are allowed
to be worn down by modern model-farm managers.</p>

<p>"The texture of the bone furnishes us with no indications,
its gloss and tenacity, if such it ever possessed, having been
entirely removed by its long maceration in water.</p>

<p>"It is however worth mentioning that this fragment from
a Scottish crannog exactly reproduces the contour of a fragment
from the Starnberger See. (See Memoir on this "find"
in the <cite>Archiv für Anthropologie</cite>, viii. 1875.) In both, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
angle of the jaw has been knocked away, for the sake, doubtless,
of the soft and succulent, and I may add sensitive,
substances it protected during life, and in both the posterior
molar has been left <em>in situ</em>, though much worn down. The
posterior molar, however, of the foreign specimen has that
superior development of its third molar, which, if Nathusius
(<cite>Schweineschädel</cite>, p. 49) had not taught us better, might have
been referred to domestication instead of to better food or
sexual (male) character. I owe this specimen to the kindness
of J. E. Lee, Esq., F.G.S., and though I hesitate in the
case of the Scottish specimen, I have no hesitation in referring
this one to the wild variety, as indeed it is referred
under the title of <em>Sus scrofa ferox</em> on the label it carried when
it came into my hands.</p>

<p>"The specimens of pigs' bones and of pigs' teeth are
numerous, but none other either of the bones or of the teeth
are of the size, strength, or proportions which would have
enabled their owners to hold their own as wild animals in
a country in which the wolf may still have existed.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>"The sheep, old dun-faced breed, <em>Ovis aries</em>, variety

variety which is known as <em>brachyura</em>,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> from having a short
tail, but which also has the horns of the goat, set on, it is true,
with their long axis at a different angle from that which they
have in the true goat, but still in themselves of very much
the same shape. One lower jaw in this series has the concave
posterior boundary, and the sinuosity anterior to its
angle, which goats usually and sheep only sometimes,
possess. It belonged, however, to an immature individual,
the posterior molar not having been evolved, and it cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
be considered to positively prove the presence here of <em>Capra
hircus</em>.</p>

<p>"The Red Deer (<em>Cervus elaphus</em>) is very abundantly represented
in this series, especially by fragments of horns, some
of which bear marks of having themselves been cut and
sawn by other implements, whilst one or two may possibly
have been used, as the tines of red deer so often were by
the early British flint miners, as borers.</p>

<p>"The Roe Deer (<em>Cervus capreolus</em>) is only scantily, though
unambiguously, represented in the collection from Lochlee.</p>

<p>"The Horse (<em>Equus caballus</em>) is represented by but a single
shoulder-blade; it is of small dimensions relatively to most
or all domestic breeds with which I am acquainted; this
applies, however, to all the domestic animal remains found
here.</p>

<p>"Reindeer (<em>Cervus tarandus</em>).&mdash;There are two more or less
fragmentary portions of horns, which, after a good deal of
comparison with other reindeer horns, and with fragments
of red deer horns, I incline to set down as indicating the
presence of the former animal in this collection. It is easy
to separate reindeer horns from red deer horns when you
have the entire antler before you, or even when you have
the brow antler only, in most cases; and it is usually easy to
separate even a fragment if the fragment is fresh, because
the surfaces of the horns in these two horns are different.
But here the two fragmentary horns in question have no
brow antler left, and their surfaces have been macerated so
long as to have desquamated, or, to change from a medical
to a geological metaphor, have been denuded a good deal.
Still one fragment is, I think, too tabular, and the other is
too tabular also, and that just below the origin of what in
the red deer is known as the sur-royal antler, to be anything
but a reindeer's.</p>

read before the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, June 14,
1869, vol. viii. pt. i. pp. 186-223, nor to his references in
that exhaustive memoir to preceding writers. But I may
mention an additional reference which Dr. J. A. Smith, not
being gifted with as much second sight as he is with
insight, could not have then referred to, as it is contained in
a book of more recent date than is his paper. This reference

<p>Regarding a subsequent consignment of bones and horns
sent to Professor Rolleston, he writes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The only remark which I feel called upon to make
relates to the bones and the teeth of the pig; the marrow
cavity in the lower jaw of one of the pigs, a young specimen,
containing a large quantity of crystals, and the teeth of the
older pigs showing a great deal of wear for the teeth of what
were, I think, domesticated swine. The crystals were
analysed by W. W. Fisher, Esq., of the Chemical Department
in the Oxford Museum, and found to be vivianite as
supposed. It is not uncommon to have bones from prehistoric
'finds,' which have been much acted on either by
fire or water, thus coloured by double decomposition of the
bone phosphate with some iron salt furnished either from
the bone and flesh or otherwise.</p>

<p>"The horns" (all the worked ones in the collection)
"received a few days ago are all of Red Deer (<em>Cervus
elaphus</em>), except one, which is of <em>Cervus capreolus</em>. With
this consignment came one bone, or rather the ulna and
radius of a <em>Bos longifrons</em>, more or less fused into one bone.
The horn of the Roe is rather a large one."</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">The Flora of the Crannog.</span></p>

<p>As there appears to be some difference of opinion among
botanists as to whether certain trees, now common in our
forests, such as elm and beech, are indigenous to Scotland,
my attention was directed at an early stage of the investigations
at Lochlee to the importance of determining the
different kinds of wood used in the structure of the crannog.
Accordingly, I collected specimens of the wood and other
vegetal remains encountered during the excavations, and in
due time forwarded them to Professor Balfour, Edinburgh,
who had kindly agreed to examine and report upon them,
but unfortunately, owing to ill-health, he was unable to
do so, and the box containing the specimens, after lying
in Edinburgh for some weeks, was returned unopened.
Ultimately, however, Dr. Bayley Balfour, Professor of
Botany in the University of Glasgow, undertook this task,
and it is to him I am therefore indebted for the following
report:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I shall send by train to-morrow the box of Lochlee
vegetable remains. I have examined them carefully, and
you will find each specimen numbered, the numbers corresponding
with those in the appended list. There is not so
much variety in the wood as I anticipated, and I am surprised
to find neither oak nor fir. The tissue of the wood is
in most cases considerably decomposed, the wood cells, as
might be expected, being most affected. Betwixt alder
(<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Alnus glutinosa</i>, L.) and poplar (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Populus tremula</i>, L.), the
only indigenous species, there is really very little difference
in wood structure, and indeed birch (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Betula alba</i>, L.) and
hazel (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Corylus Avellana</i>, L.) are not far removed, so that
that when the texture of the wood is much compressed, and
decomposition has progressed, an identification is somewhat
hazardous, and I have therefore queried my determination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
in some cases. No beech occurs amongst the specimens you
sent me."</p>

<p>The following is a summary of the detailed list:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <em>Brushwood, etc.</em>&mdash;The various specimens of wood which
were selected from below the log pavement have been classified
as belonging to one or other of the following trees, viz.,
birch (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Betula alba</i>), hazel (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Corylus Avellana</i>), alder (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Alnus
glutinosa</i>), and willow (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Salix</i>, sp.).</p>

<p>II. <em>Wooden Relics.</em>&mdash;One of the implements (Fig. <a href="#Page_121">118</a>),
which appeared to be made of a different kind of wood from
any of the rest, has been identified by Dr. Balfour as elm
(<em>Ulmus montana</em>, Sm.); and the piece of board with the
carved diagrams (see pages <a href="#Page_134">134</a>, <a href="#Page_135">135</a>) is found to be ash (<em>Fraxinus
excelsior</em>, L.). The rest of the relics were not submitted
to Dr. Balfour, as they had so crumbled into dust (except
those made of oak, all of which were easily recognised) that
their identification appeared impossible.</p>

<p>III. Among the remaining vegetal remains collected
from the débris above the log pavement, Dr. Balfour has
identified the following species:&mdash;</p>

<p>"(1.) <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Hypnum</i> (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Hylocomium</i>) <em>splendens</em>, Dill. This specimen
I submitted for confirmation to Mr. Hobkirk of Huddersfield,
and after the most careful examination he refers it
to the above.</p>

<p>"(2.) <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Dædalea quercina</i>, P. This I submitted to Dr. M.
C. Cooke for confirmation, and he remarks, 'Must be a thin
form of that species; but of course it is very much discoloured,
and hence difficult to determine.'</p>

<p>"(3.) <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Bovista nigrescens</i>, P.</p>

<p>"(4.) <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Polyporus igniarius</i>, Fr. This and the preceding
are Dr. M. C. Cooke's identification.</p>

<p>"(5.) <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Polytrichum commune</i>, L. (Portions from the fringe-like
girdles (Fig. <a href="#Page_136">151</a>) and the pigtail-like object described
at page <a href="#Page_95">95</a> were thus labelled.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"(6.) <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Pteris aquilina</i>, L.</p>

<p>"(7.) Several masses containing roots and root leaves of
a monocotyledonous plant with equitant leaves, heather
stems, and rhizomes of fern.</p>

<p>"(8.) Portions of birch bark in stripes rolled together like
a ball of thread.</p>

<p>"(9.) Hazel nuts. One gnawed by a <em>squirrel</em>? If, as I
conjecture, it has been done by a squirrel, it is interesting, as
affording evidence of their occurrence in this locality.</p>

<p>"I am sorry I am unable to be more definite in many
cases. The masses made up of monocotyledonous plants
would not repay a more extended examination."</p>


<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">General Remarks.</span></p>

<p>To extract from the above investigations, however suggestive
the results may appear, a life history, as it were, of
the crannog, or indeed much reliable information regarding
the habits of the Celtic races who flourished in the neighbourhood
during the period of its existence, would be presumptuous
on my part, if not beyond the scope of legitimate
inference, especially in face of the meagre results hitherto
obtained from Scottish crannogs. The completeness with
which the operations have been executed, together with the
great variety of relics found, cannot fail to make the Lochlee
crannog a standard of comparison for future discoveries of a
similar character, at least for some time to come, and hence
it was essential to have the present report free from all
speculative opinions. I have therefore up to this point
entirely confined myself to matters of fact which have come
under my own direct cognisance; and as for the relics, I
have simply endeavoured to describe them accurately, leaving
it to experienced archæologists to determine their historical
value. There are however a few points, bearing on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the antiquity and duration of the crannog, which, though
undoubtedly included in the category of the speculative, I
wish to state, as they could only be made by one conversant
with all the phases of the excavations; but which, after this
caution, must be taken <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">cum grano salis</i>.</p>

<p>1. <em>Position of Relics.</em>&mdash;As many of the relics, if judged
independently of the rest and their surroundings, would be
taken as good representatives of the three so-called ages of
Stone, Bronze, and Iron, it is but natural for the reader to
inquire if superposition has defined them by a corresponding
relationship. On this point I offer no dubious opinion. The
polished stone celt, Fig. <a href="#Page_106">55</a>, and the knife, Fig. <a href="#Page_125">129</a>, were found
almost in juxtaposition about the level of the lowest fireplace.
Though the hammer-stones, as a rule, were more
abundant in the lower strata, yet the very first thing indicating
human art which was found, when we commenced to
dig towards the centre of the mound, was a hammer-stone.
Almost all the horn implements were found at or below the
level of the first-discovered pavement, and three-fourths of
the querns were found above it. Below the same level, and
around the hearths, tusks of boars were numerous, whereas
almost none were found above it; and in the midden pigs'
jaws and teeth were found only at its lowest stratum. Various
inferences might be drawn from these remarks, which
my readers can do for themselves.</p>

<p>2. <em>Character of the Wood-work.</em>&mdash;From the discovery, in
the deep section made below the log pavement, of beams
with tenons and mortised holes, and large trunks having
their branches lopped off as if with a hatchet, it would
appear that the first constructors of the crannog were well
acquainted with the use of metal tools. It may also be
noted that the base of the wood-work of the island was at
least 14 feet (after making allowance for the extra height of
the mound) below the surface of the field, whereas that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the gangway, within a few feet of the crannog, was only
10 feet. This difference of 4 feet could hardly be accounted
for by the inequality of the bed of the lake, as the field
appeared here to be quite level, so that we must infer either
that it was due to the absolute weight of the island on the
portion of the bed of the lake directly below it, or that the
gangway was of more recent construction than the island.
After all these doubtful elements are eliminated, there
remains the important fact that since the island was constructed,
10 feet of silt, at least, had accumulated around it.</p>

<p>That broken planks and old mortised beams were mixed
up with the trestle-work in various places, would support the
idea of a prior structure; while evidence that the whole
superstructure had at one or more times been destroyed by
fire was quite conclusive. According to this theory, the
elaborate mortised beams at the north-east corner might
have been a landing-stage, but, in their present position,
they are quite inexplicable.</p>

<p>3. <em>Level of Lake.</em>&mdash;Amongst the problems of a discursive
character here referred to, perhaps there is none of greater
interest than that which deals with the cause and effect of
the change that has taken place in the level of the lake.
From eye-witnesses we know that, before the first drainage
was carried out, the mound used to be covered with water
in the winter-time; and Mr. Charles Reid tells me that the
line of level which he has adopted in measuring for the plan
of the lake is 8 feet 7 inches above the log pavement. Now
the area assigned to the lake by Mr. Reid is considerably
less than what the old residenters of the district make it out
to have been, as several of them have stated that they had
seen its waters extend beyond the road on the west side
(see Plan), and yet from his data the depth of water would
just cover the highest part of the mound, which, it will be
remembered, was about the same height above the log<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
pavement. Originally the island must have been higher than
the lake, but allowing that the log pavement was only 3 feet
above the surface of the water, we have at least 11 feet of
change of level to account for. This phenomenon could
only be caused by a sinking of the whole island, or a rising
of the water, or a combination of both causes. I do not
think that the weight of the island and its superincumbent
mass would press so heavily on the bottom of the lake as to
cause it to sink much, since the enormous amount of wood-work,
of which it consisted, being lighter than water, would
have a corresponding buoyant effect, and so help to counteract
the weight of the aërial portion. Nor has any great
compression of its substance taken place from decay, because
in the course of making the deep section under the log pavement,
we found the contour of the large trees quite symmetrical
and perfectly round; and although the wood was
very soft it was not compressed, owing to its being completely
saturated with water, which of course is virtually
incompressible. Although I have often seen small brushwood
flattened from pressure, yet I have never seen this
effect produced on a branch larger than my wrist, and only
in one instance did I notice it on a piece of wood of this size.
Moreover, the gangway, which certainly could not sink
from its weight, was deeply buried, its uppermost horizontal
beams being not less than 7 feet below the surface of the
field. We must therefore fall back on the only other alternatives,
and assign this change in the relative position of the
crannog and level of the lake either to a general compression
and sinking of the bed of the lake or to the rising of
the water. The latter result is somewhat unusual, because
running water, having a tendency to deepen its channel,
and the accumulation of sedimentary deposits, often produce
an opposite effect, and cause the complete drainage of lake
basins. I have therefore carefully examined the outlet of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the lake to ascertain if possible the causes that led to this
rise in its bed.</p>

<p>Its natural outflow was at the south-east corner, and the
little stream, after running southwards for a few yards,
quickly turned westwards into a narrow valley which
wended towards Fail Loch. Just at this abrupt turning the
background rose somewhat steeply to the south, so that the
termination of the valley as it entered into the Lochlee
basin was very liable to be obstructed by débris washed
from the slopes above. Besides being thus favourably situated
to catch washed-down materials, it is probable that
during the summer the surplus water would be very scanty,
and vegetation abundant, so that in the course of time the
bed of the outlet would gradually be raised. A section cut
across the outlet would readily disclose the sequence of the
silted materials, had it not been that the soil was disturbed
by a deep covered drain, which was made when the first
drainage operations were executed, and ran along its whole
course. Also, I understand that previous to this the lake
was used as a mill-dam. We cannot therefore get rid of the
elements of uncertainty in any calculations which might be
based on the change of the level of the lake and the accumulation
of silt in its bed and outlet.</p>

<p>I may however mention, on the grounds already stated,
that since the foundations of the crannog were laid, the
increase in the bed of the lake in its vicinity cannot have
been less than 10 or 14 feet; and 11 feet is the lowest estimate
that I can assign to the submergence of its surface.
On the supposition that this apparent encroachment of the
water was uniform, and since the last fireplace was about
6 feet above the lowest, and allowing 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> feet for the time
the former was used, we have then the total period of occupancy
of the crannog represented by 7<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> feet of total submergence.
We have no means of comparing this period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
with its representation in so many feet of lake sediment,
but I may state that since the canoe, found about 100 yards
from the crannog, was abandoned, no less than 5 feet of
this mossy lake sediment accumulated over it.</p>

<p>The composition of the silt forming the bed of the lake,
especially near the crannog, as already described at pp. 98, 99,
points to the fact that for centuries the increase was due
principally to the decomposition of vegetable matters, while
latterly it was caused more by a deposition of fine clay;
and when excavating along the line of the gangway we had
an opportunity of verifying the regularity of this succession.
A change so marked in the sediment can only be accounted
for by a corresponding change in the surrounding scenery,
and no explanation is more likely than that the primeval
forests had given place to the inroads of agriculture, when
some of the upturned virgin soil would be washed down,
as it still is, by every trickling rill that finds its way into
this lake basin.</p>

<p class="p3a">SUBSEQUENT RESEARCHES AND DISCOVERIES AT FRIARS' CARSE,
LOCHSPOUTS, BARHAPPLE, AND BUSTON.</p>


<p>Before the interesting series of objects obtained from the
excavation of the Lochlee crannog, and described in the
previous chapter, could be properly illustrated and efficiently
brought under the notice of antiquaries, other promising
"finds" of a similar nature were announced from various
quarters. All these have now, as far as practicable, been
carefully investigated, with results, in some respects, even
more remarkable than the former. To a description of
these further excavations and discoveries I propose to devote
this chapter, commencing with that of a lake-dwelling at
Friars' Carse, in Dumfriesshire, and following it up by
others in the order of their discovery.</p>


<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">Section I.</span></p>

<p class="center"><em>Notes of a Crannog at Friars' Carse, Dumfriesshire.</em></p>

<p>Early in the summer of 1879 I was informed that, during
the autumn of the preceding year, a lake-dwelling had been
exposed in a small loch at Friars' Carse, Dumfriesshire, and
being then engaged in drawing up a report of the excavations
made at Lochlee, I was anxious to have an opportunity
of comparing the results obtained from the former with
those of the latter. This opportunity was afforded me by
the Rev. Mr. Landsborough, who, being also interested in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
discoveries, made arrangements with his friend, Dr. Grierson
of Thornhill, to conduct us to Friars' Carse. After inspecting
a canoe, some fragments of pottery, and a few other
things from this crannog, then deposited in Dr. Grierson's
museum, we drove off to inspect the structure itself. Its
site was a small pear-shaped basin situated behind a wooded
knoll, close to the Parliamentary road to Dumfries, and in
the midst of a well-cultivated but singularly undulating
district. By deepening the outlet of this lake to the extent
of 2 feet, a partial drainage was effected, which reduced its
area from 10 to 3 acres. It was then that it became generally
known that a small bushy island near the middle of
the loch had been artificially constructed of oak logs and
trunks of trees. As the weather was dry for some weeks
previous to our visit, and the water particularly low, we
readily stepped on to the island, over what appeared to have
been the old bed of the lake, then presenting a hard, crisp,
and dried-up surface of aquatic plants. The island was
nearly circular in shape, strongly built, and surrounded by
piles, some of which, however, were only visible through the
water. The log pavement, which by this time had been
completely bared, was composed of parallel beams of oak,
apparently arranged in groups, lying in various directions,
and firmly united together by the overlapping and sometimes
mortising of their ends. Its level was from 1 to 2 feet above
that of the water, but at the margin of the island there was
a large quantity of stones, especially on its north side, <em>i.e.</em>
the side towards the deepest portion of the lake, and most
distant from the outlet. Through these stones, which shelved
under the water, a few heads of the surrounding piles projected,
some of which were also visible above the water.
Some mortised holes were here and there to be seen in the
horizontal beams, but there was no trace of a raised breastwork
surrounding the wooden pavement&mdash;thus differing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
this respect from the crannog at Lochlee, and agreeing with
that at Lochspouts. In the centre were a few ends of uprights,
in rectangular rows, seemingly the remains of partitions,
one of which I traced for 40 feet in a straight line.</p>

<p>Upon inquiring where the rubbish removed from the
island was located, we were informed that it had been
wheeled to the west side of the crannog, and heaped up
just close to where we had stepped across to the island.
Here it lay for some days; but one morning, to the great
astonishment of the workmen, it was found to have entirely
disappeared. Upon examination, it turned out that the
apparently dry land was a matted crust of mud and roots
of aquatic plants, which virtually floated over the water, and
suddenly gave way under the accumulated weight, and so
buried the whole mass in the water beneath. With this
singular and unfortunate catastrophe terminated all further
prospects of finding relics.</p>

<p>My examination of the crannog was then of a very
limited character, and hence, when I came to require more
definite information, I found it necessary to revisit the
locality. This visit took place so recently as the 31st
January 1882, and, although a day by no means suitable
for such investigations, I am glad to say that through the
courtesy and kindness of the proprietor, Thomas Nelson,
Esq., who was personally conversant with the drainage
operations, and took much interest in the Lake-Dwelling,
the following additional details were procured:&mdash;</p>

<p>The island is slightly oval in shape, and, including the
partially submerged zone in which the piles were noticed,
measures 80 by 70 feet. Near its centre the débris was
from 2 to 3 feet thick, and formed a sort of mound containing
ashes, charcoal, and some bones. Here the fragments
of pottery afterwards described were found.</p>

was covered with small stones as if to protect it from fire;
also some remains of clay flooring were observed in other
parts of the island.</p>

<p>Regarding the deeper structures little can be said. Mr.
Nelson attempted to cut a hole through the timber, and,
as far as the water allowed the men to penetrate, he saw
nothing but layer upon layer of oak beams lying transversely
upon each other. Judging, however, from the solidity and
firmness of the island, the great size of some of the logs, and
the depth of the loch (still about 12 feet a little to the west
of the island), the total thickness of this immense mass of
timber cannot, I should say, be less than 12 or 16 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. Nelson has directed my attention to the following
notice of this island in the <cite>Antiquities of Scotland</cite>, by Grose,
vol. i. p. 146.</p>


<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">Friars' Carse, in Nithsdale.</span></p>

<p>"Here was a cell dependent on the rich abbey of Melrose,
which, at the Reformation, was granted by the Commendator
to the Laird of Elliesland, a cadet of the Kirkpatricks of
Closeburne. From whom it passed to the Maxwells of Tinwald,
and from them to the Barncleugh family, also cadets
of the Lords of Maxwell. From whom it went to the
Riddells, of Glenriddell, the present possessors. The old
refectory, or dining-room, had walls 8 feet thick, and the
chimney was 12 feet wide. This old building having become
ruinous, was pulled down in 1773, to make way for the
present house.</p>

<p>"Near the house was the Lough, which was the fish-pond
of the friary. In the middle of which is a very curious
artificial island, founded upon large piles and planks of oak,
where the monks lodged their valuable effects when the
English made an inroad into Strathnith."</p>

<p>From the above quotation it would appear that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
structure has not ceased to be an island by becoming submerged, like
most of the other lake-dwellings hitherto noticed. The surface of the
log pavement is at present about 18 inches above the water-level, so
that, before the recent drainage, it would be 6 inches below it, but,
originally, it must have been 3 or 4 feet above the ordinary level of
the loch. Hence, on the supposition that no great alteration was made
on the lake area by former cuttings, the maximum amount of subsidence
would not be more than 5 feet.</p>

</div>

<p><em>Canoe.</em>&mdash;About 60 yards from the island, while making the cut
for drainage, a canoe was found, "deeply imbedded" in the mud (about
4 feet). It now lies in Dr. Grierson's museum at Thornhill, but it
has become so shrivelled and distorted that it would be difficult to
recognise it as a dug-out canoe. From Dr. Grierson's description of
it, shortly after discovery, it appears to have been 22 feet long and
2 feet 10 inches broad. The prow was the root end of the tree, and
tapered to a point, but the stern, which was squarely cut, was closed
by a flat sternpiece fitting into a groove.</p>

<p>A neatly formed paddle was found on the west side of the loch. Its
length is 3 feet 10 inches, of which the blade takes up 1 foot 6 inches
by 5 inches broad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>The ponderous axe hammer-head here figured (Fig. 159),
was found on the west side of the loch along with the
paddle. "It was about 2 feet below the present surface, and
about 30 yards from the island, at a place where the
ground was firmer and might have been a landing-place
from the island." It is made of hard whinstone, and measures
10 inches in length, 5 inches in breadth, and a shade less
than 3 inches in depth. It is perforated by a round shaft-hole,
2 inches in diameter, but tapers slightly from both
surfaces to the middle.</p>

<p><em>Pottery.</em>&mdash;Two handles of jars with a yellowish glaze,
inclining in some parts to a green and in others to a reddish-brown
colour.</p>

<p>Two fragments of a large dish were ornamented by a
series of little pits regularly grouped together in the form
of bands as represented in Figs. 160 and 161. These bands
were formed of three parallel rows of pits, which in the
larger fragment radiated from the base upwards at a distance
of about an inch, but became a little wider at the
bulge of the dish. The other fragment (Fig. 161) is too
small to indicate the direction of the pitted rows, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
the band is decidedly raised above the general surface of
the vessel&mdash;a feature which is only partially noticeable
in the former, just at the upper termination of the rows.
The little indentations are irregularly shaped, but, from
a repetition of the same peculiarities in their form in
each row, it is clear that they were made by a small
trident-like implement.</p>

<p>All these fragments of pottery were made of a fine
reddish clay, mixed with coarse sand or small quartz pebbles.</p>

<p>The only other relics were a circular stone polisher,
2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches in diameter, and an oval-shaped mass of vitreous
paste.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Notice of the Excavation of a Crannog at Lochspouts,
near Kilkerran.</em></p>

<p><em>Situation of Crannog.</em>&mdash;Lochspouts is situated about
three miles to the south-west of Maybole, in the parish
of Kirkoswald, and on the property of the Right Honourable
Sir James Fergusson, of Kilkerran, Bart., K.C.M.G., LL.D.
It is a small lake basin, somewhat oval in shape, and
ensconced at the base of hilly ground, which encompasses
it, except towards the north, where a narrow trap-dike runs
across and cuts it off from the open valley beyond. It is
thus a natural dam, formed in the face of a declivity, which,
beyond the trap ridge, still continues to slope rapidly downwards
for a few hundred yards. No outlet could therefore
at any time exist, except along this barrier, and an inspection
of its present condition reveals several deep gashes,
through which at one time the surplus water made its
escape. Indeed, some of the oldest inhabitants state that
the name "Lochspouts" was given to it because, in former
times, during heavy floods, its waters spouted across this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
ridge at different points. The truth of this traditional report
is not only consistent with the physical and geological
features of the locality, but supplies a good illustration of
the natural process by which running streams are occasionally
known to cut out new channels, and ultimately abandon
their former beds altogether. Owing to the large amount
of silt washed into this basin, and the gradual lowering of
its outlet by the frictional erosion of the surplus water, the
area of the lake must also have been gradually diminished,
so that it is difficult to estimate its original size. Immediately
prior, however, to human interference with the rocky
barrier, it would not be more than eight acres. This singular
and, when surrounded by primeval forests, secluded little
lake, was selected by the ancient crannog-builders as a
suitable site for building one of their characteristic island
dwellings, the remains of which have only been recently
discovered. The starting-point of the investigations now
about to be recorded was the following letter:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">Inland Revenue Office,</span><br />
<span class="mleft6 smcap">Campbelton</span>, <cite>8th October 1879</cite>.</p>

<p>"To the Right Honourable<br />
<span class="mleft3">Sir</span> <span class="smcap">James Fergusson</span>, Bart.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Would you permit me, a perfect stranger, to bring
under your notice the circumstance that at Lochspoots, on your
estate, there are the remains of an ancient lake-dwelling, which
do not appear to have been ever examined.</p>

<p>"Lochspoots was formerly of some depth, but within the lifetime
of old people the lip of rock which forms its lower rim
was cut with the view of utilising the water of the lake for the
purposes of a walk-mill. This operation probably reduced the
level about 10 feet, and must have brought the bottom of the
shallower parts to the surface.</p>

<p>"When on a visit a few years ago to my brother, who is tenant
of this farm, I noticed a mound which I suspected to be the site
of an old lake-dwelling, and on digging into it my suspicion was
confirmed. My exploration was of the most limited kind; still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
I found a bronze armlet&mdash;the metal almost all oxidised&mdash;two
sling-stones, and two pieces of colouring matter, the one red and
the other black. I also ascertained that in cutting a drain a
canoe had been dug out of the moss and clay; and on making
further inquiry I found it in possession of the previous tenant. I
did not measure it, but it appeared small, and to agree with the
published accounts of the ruder forms of the canoes found in the
Clyde beds.</p>

<p>"As the mound rises above the level of the water, it could be
partially examined without much labour or expense; but as the
lake water soon finds its way into holes of any depth, no proper
or systematic examination could be made without cutting deeper
into the ledge of rock that forms the embankment. The rock
has already been cut to a depth of 12 or 15 feet, and a few feet
more would probably reduce the level below the upper surface of
the virgin clay. Fortunately none of the streams that drain into
the lake are near the spot, and consequently only a thin covering
of lacustrine clay has been deposited over the débris.&mdash;I most
respectfully remain, sir, your most obedient and humble servant, <span class="smcap shiftright">James MacFadzean</span>."</p></blockquote>

<p>Sir James Fergusson at once forwarded this interesting
letter to R. W. Cochran-Patrick, Esq., LL.D., F.S.A., secretary
to the Ayrshire and Wigtownshire Archæological Association,
with a note requesting him to visit and examine the locality
here referred to at his convenience. From letters now before
me I find that this preliminary examination of the crannog
took place on the 10th of the following November, the result
of which was shortly afterwards communicated to me just at
the same time that I had received for final revision the proof-sheets
of the first article on the Ayrshire crannogs, and so I
took the opportunity of recording the discovery by appending
a foot-note embracing Mr. Cochran-Patrick's observations.
See page 23 of the second volume of the collections of the
Ayrshire and Wigtownshire Archæological Association.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>The time of the year being unsuitable for making an
examination of the crannog, owing to the wetness of the
locality, it was agreed to postpone further explorations till
the following summer.</p>

<p>Meantime the appointment of Sir James Fergusson as
Governor of Bombay, and the subsequent return of Mr.
Cochran-Patrick as M.P. for North Ayrshire, entirely precluded
both these gentlemen from giving their personal
attention to the proposed investigations, in which they were
so highly interested; and hence the carrying out of them,
when a favourable opportunity should occur, was intrusted
to me.</p>

<p><em>Investigations.</em>&mdash;It was not till the 28th June 1880 that
the weather permitted the work of excavating the mound
to be begun, which, however, was then continued regularly
during the greater part of the month of July, under the most
favourable circumstances. A long course of dry weather
made the ground exceptionally suitable for digging; the
workmen, with the intelligent forester, Mr. Hopson, at their
head, were skilful and thoroughly interested in the investigations;
and as to the general management, not only had we
the benefit of the able and obliging assistance of Mr. Baxter,
factor on the Kilkerran estate, but also the occasional presence
and advice of several members of the Council of this Society,
among whom were R. W. Cochran-Patrick, Esq., M.P., Sir
W. J. M. Cuninghame, Bart., of Corsehill, Colonel Hunter-Weston
of Hunterston, J. H. Stoddart, Esq., <cite>Glasgow
Herald</cite>, etc. I have specially to mention Dr. Macdonald,
rector of the Ayr Academy, who for several days took the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
entire supervision of the works and finds. It will be thus
seen that the materials of this report are the joint contributions
of various hands and various minds, so that the individuality
which the writing of it confers upon me must be
largely discounted.</p>

<p>Upon my first visit to Lochspouts, I was struck with the
smallness of its dimensions; its superficies, according to
measurements kindly made by Mr. Brown, clerk to Mr.
Baxter, being only 2 acres. Its margin, and indeed its whole
area, were thickly covered with long grasses and rushes. On
its north side, near the middle portion of the rocky ridge,
and a little to the west of the outlet, lay the remains of the
crannog, a low circular mound overgrown with coarse grass,
and so close to the present margin of the lake that it formed
a peninsula easily approached by <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">terra firma</i>. I understand,
however, that when Mr. Cochran-Patrick visited it in the
previous October, the neck of land, now dry, was so soft
and boggy that it was with difficulty he got across to the
mound.</p>

<p>These observations will be more clearly comprehended
by a reference to the accompanying sketch (Frontispiece),
taken by a young artist, Mr. J. Lawson, when the explorations
were nearly completed. The view is looking northwards. In
the foreground are the marshy loch and crannog (the overlying
mound being now nearly cleared away), then the rocky ridge
extending right and left, behind which is the open valley,
with the hill Culdoon, and monument to the late Sir Charles
Dalrymple Fergusson in the distance. Along this ridge are
seen several hollows, which are supposed to have been
formerly outlets; the original or primary one being at the
extreme right, while about the middle, and almost in a line
with the crannog, is the artificial cutting which forms the
present outlet.</p>

<p>Previous to my visit there were no piles detected on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
mound, but after a considerable amount of searching the tops
of one or two were observed on its east side, at the bottom
of a sluggish channel kept open by the surplus water making
its way to the outlet. Guided by these indications and a
few trials with the spade, the tops of others were exposed,
so that in a short time half the circle was thus traced. After
due deliberation, in consultation with Mr. Baxter, who, on
behalf of the proprietor, supplied the men and the labouring
materials, it was agreed that the only exploration that could
then be made, without further cutting of the rock (an undertaking
which would involve a large amount of expense), was
to clear away the entire mound down to the level of the water.
Accordingly, the men were directed to make a broad trench,
running east and west, the stuff from which was to be
removed in layers, so as to localise, as far as possible, any
remains that might be found. When this was finished,
another similar trench was made at right angles to the
former, after which the four remaining angular portions were
removed. In the course of these excavations the following
facts regarding the structure and surroundings of the crannog
were ascertained:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <em>Log Pavement.</em>&mdash;About 5 feet deep (measuring from
centre of mound), and only a few inches above the level of
surrounding water, there was exposed a rude, imperfect, and
irregularly-shaped wooden pavement, formed of flattened
oak beams. It covered only the central portion of the area
contained within the circle of piles, the rest of which was
laid with branches and stems of trees. Near the surrounding
piles, on the east side, a more carefully constructed
arrangement of this wood-work was noticed, consisting of
slanting stakes and horizontal beams of various sizes, forming
a sort of reticulated and firm flooring, which sloped
slightly downwards towards the piles. A similar disposition
of the marginal wood-work was noticed elsewhere, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
on the north-west side, in a line with the gangway to be
afterwards described; but on the lake side of the crannog
the exact mode of its structure was not practically exposed
to view, owing to its shelving below the water, but the presumption
is that it was pretty much the same all round.
On digging beneath this log pavement large beams and
brushwood were generally encountered, but the voluminous
gushing up of water prevented reliable observations from
being made regarding these deeper structures. Occasionally
ashes and charcoal were turned up, and in one spot, near the
centre, and under my own inspection, the men succeeded in
digging downwards more than 2 feet below the log pavement
before the water oozed up, in the course of which
nothing was turned out but pure ashes, bits of charcoal, and
large quantities of the shells of limpets and common wilks.
At the bottom of this hole were solid oak beams, apparently
flattened; but no sooner were their surfaces exposed than
the water rushed in and filled the trench. This gave rise to
the conjecture that this under-stratum of remains represented
another, and of course an older, period of human occupancy,
which also derived some support from the fact that
the surface of the log pavement was on a higher level than
the tops of the encircling piles. It occurred to me, however,
that it was a prepared cavity, and originally intended for
the purpose for which it was evidently used, viz. an ashpit;
and hence, from want of corroborative evidence, the conjecture
that the log pavement is a secondary one, and superimposed
on the débris of a former dwelling, must for the
present remain <em>sub judice</em>. Although portions of mortised
beams were in several instances met with, there were no
remains found of a circle of stockades having transverse
beams, and raised above the log flooring, as was the case at
the Lochlee crannog. Had such a structure existed, it
would have been removed in all likelihood when the lake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
was lowered, as the whole wood-work would have been exposed
to view. The diameter of the crannog, <em>i.e.</em> of the
circular area enclosed within the submerged piles, was
about 95 feet. No further attempt was made to examine
the marginal structure of the island owing to its submerged
condition; but the probability is, judging from analogy and
the certainty of one circle of piles, that an outer circle exists,
with which the former is connected by the usual type of
mortised beams.</p>

<p>2. <em>Hearths.</em>&mdash;Above the log pavement, and a few yards
apart from each other, were three circular hearths, each
about 5 feet in diameter, formed of flat stones imbedded in
a bed of yellow clay, and raised on a sort of pedestal of clay
and stones, which varied in thickness from 1 to 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> foot.
One of them, on being demolished, was found to have been
built directly over a former stony hearth, with an interval
of about a foot. The stuff immediately surrounding them
consisted of alternate layers of clay and ashes; and from the
number of such layers, indicating collectively a considerable
thickness&mdash;in one place over 3 feet&mdash;it appeared to me that
the position of these hearths could not be taken as a criterion
of the length of occupancy in the same way as the superimposed
series at Lochlee, inasmuch as abundant evidence of
the remains of fires were found where no neatly constructed
hearth was observed. As will be seen from a glance at the
sketch of Lochspouts (see the Frontispiece), they were all
situated near the centre of the crannog, but on its southern
half, <em>i.e.</em> the semicircle farthest from the shore.</p>

<p>3. <em>Gangway.</em>&mdash;On making a few trial trenches in the
space directly between the shore and the crannog in search
of a gangway, we could find no indications of wood-work.
One day, however, my attention was directed to a portion of
the log pavement which looked like a wooden roadway projecting
to the margin of the island, and pointing in a north-western<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
direction, towards a prominence in the trap ridge.
Observing, also, that before the lake was lowered this prominence
would be the nearest land to the crannog, it immediately
struck me that if there was a gangway at all it would
be found along this line. Hypothesis was right this time.
The adhesive nature of the lake sediment prevented the
water from oozing up so quickly as it did on the crannog,
so that we were enabled to expose the wood-work several
feet below the level of the lake. Close to the crannog the
upper beams of the gangway were about 3 feet below the
surface of the grass, and fully more below that of the log
pavement; but as we neared the shore with the digging
they became less buried, and some of the uprights were
found even projecting above the ground.</p>

<p>The general plan on which this gangway was constructed
appeared to be identical with that adopted by the crannog-builders
of Lochlee. Upright piles, singly and in groups,
were placed in a zigzag fashion, between which the horizontal
beams stretched, fan-like, and so formed a sort of lattice-work,
with empty lozenge-shaped spaces between. From
one of these holes or meshes, some 5 feet below the surface
of the ground, a fine granite quern-stone was extracted.
The piles projected some 2 feet or more above the body of
the gangway, but there was no appearance of the remains of
a platform. The depth of the lower portion of the gangway
could not be reached. It would thus appear that at least
the transverse beams of the gangway were originally under
water&mdash;a remark equally applicable to that at Lochlee; and
it is highly probable that the primary purpose of this so-called
gangway was to supply, on emergencies, a means of
secret access to the crannog.</p>

<p>4. <em>Composition of Mound.</em>&mdash;The surface of the mound was
composed of coarse grass, having tough matted roots spreading
in a thin layer of soil, which overlay about a foot and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
half of stones and rubbish, in which no relics were found.
Below this the materials were of a very variable character;
sometimes vegetable mould, stems of grasses jointed like
straw, and beds of heather and moss, which could readily be
separated into layers; and at other times heaps of ashes
and charcoal mixed with quantities of the shells of wilks,
limpets, and hazel-nuts. Intermingled with this heterogeneous
mass were large and small stones, broken bones, portions
of deer horns, and the relics to be afterwards described.
Though one or two ashpits, mostly composed of fine ashes,
sea-shells, and broken hazel-nuts, were distinctly discernible
in the vicinity of the fireplaces, no regular refuse-heap was
met with; and the broken bones and horns seemed to be
dispersed over the general area of the crannog.</p>

<p>5. <em>Subsidence of Crannog.</em>&mdash;In discussing the question
regarding the Lochlee crannog I had to contend with an
element of very great uncertainty, viz., the impossibility of
ascertaining how much of the apparent sinking of the crannog
was due to the rising of the level of the lake in consequence
of the filling up of the bed of the outlet. This
doubtful element is, however, entirely eliminated from the
problem as it is presented to us at Lochspouts. Whatever
alterations may have taken place in the position of the
outlet, one thing is certain, that the tendency could never
be to raise the level of the lake. Hence, if we can fix on the
position of the natural outlet when the artificial cutting was
made, the minimum amount of subsidence of the crannog
resolves itself into simply measuring the height of this
point above the present surface of the log pavement. I
use the word <em>minimum</em>, because, to determine the actual
amount, other two elements have to be considered, both of
which tend to magnify the amount of subsidence, viz. (1)
How much the surface of the crannog was originally above
water; and (2) the amount of lowering of the lake, due to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
frictional erosion of the water at the outlet, during the interval
between the founding of the crannog and the date of the
artificial cutting of the rock. For the present I entirely
exclude both these elements; so that the solution of the
problem depends on the practicability of ascertaining the
height of the lowest natural outlet above the level of the
log pavement. I believe the primary outlet was at the extreme
east end of the barrier, where it disappears into the
hillside. Here is to be seen a large deep opening, naturally
scooped out of the rock; the lowest portion of which is only
16<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> feet above the present level of the lake. It was, however,
found, on measurement, that a lower natural outlet
was just in the site of the present artificial cutting. The
upper portion of the latter is wide, but about 14 feet from
the running water it contracts into a narrow channel with
perpendicular sides, and the sole difficulty is to determine
where nature ended and art began. If we suppose that the
whole of this narrow channel was artificially cut, then the
lake must have been lowered to a corresponding extent.
This, however, may be beyond the mark, as in the course of
time the water itself would make a similar channel. After
repeated and most careful inspections of this spot, I am
inclined to fix the minimum amount of cutting at 10 or 12
feet. Based, therefore, on the lowest estimate, the original
surface of the crannog must have subsided over 10 feet, as
it is now just on a level with the lake water.</p>


<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">Relics.</span></p>

<p>No inference worthy of note could be drawn from the
relative position of the relics found on this crannog. They
were interspersed amongst the débris, chiefly around the fireplaces
and over the area of the log pavement, at a depth
varying according to their distance from the centre of the
mound, but none more superficial than about 18 inches from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
its surface. Though in point of number and variety the
general collection is not equal to that from Lochlee, it is
scarcely inferior to it in archæological importance. Following
the system of arrangement adopted in the latter, I have
described the various articles under the several heads suggested
by the respective materials of which they are made.</p>


<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">I. Objects made of Stone.</span></p>

<p><em>Hammer-Stones.</em>&mdash;These implements were in great
abundance, forty of which were collected and transferred to
Kilkerran House. According to the principle of classification
hinted at in the description of those found at Lochlee,
which is based exclusively on their shape and the position
of the markings, they fall to be arranged in three groups.</p>

<p><em>First</em>, Two are somewhat flat and circular, about 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
inches in diameter, and exhibit markings all round the edge.</p>

<p><em>Second</em>, Three, similarly shaped, have the markings on
the flat surfaces alone, and appear to have been held when
used with one of the flat surfaces in the palm of the hand.</p>

<p><em>Third</em>, The rest are more or less elongated, and show
wrought surfaces at one or both ends. The largest, made of
a fine-grained dolorite, is beautifully polished, tapers slightly
towards one end, and measures 7 inches long by 4 broad.
A few more were of the same material; and Mr. J. Thomson,
F.G.S., Glasgow, informs me that this rock is only found <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in
situ</i> at Ailsa Craig, but that water-worn pebbles of it are
abundant along the seashore in the neighbourhood of
Girvan.</p>

<p><em>Polishers.</em>&mdash;Under this head I classify about a dozen
pestle-like implements, notwithstanding that slight pounding
markings were observed at the ends of one or two of
them, because they are all over so smooth and glossy that
they seemed to have been used rather for polishing or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
smoothing some soft material, than as hammer-stones. There
are also about a similar number of flat polishers, varying
much both in size and shape, one of which is triangularly
shaped like a modern smoothing-iron. It measures 5 inches
long, 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> broad at base, and 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inch thick.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 162.&mdash;Whetstone (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>).</p></div>
</div>

<p><em>Whetstones.</em>&mdash;These are also numerous, but it is difficult to
draw a minute distinction between them and the polishers.
They vary in length from 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> to 6<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches, and are mostly
composed of hard claystone or indurated sandstone. One
of them, judging from the only fragment which was found,
was manufactured with great care, and had a small hole at
one end for suspension. This fragment, which is here figured
(Fig. <a href="#Page_170">162</a>), measures 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches long, 2 broad, and half an
inch thick.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 163.&mdash;Whetstone (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>).</p></div>
</div>

<p>Another is made of fine-grained sandstone, and shaped
precisely similar to the sharpening-stones now used for
scythes. Its dimensions are 5<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches long, <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inch broad,
and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inch deep (Fig. <a href="#Page_170">163</a>).</p>

<p><em>Funnel-shaped Holes.</em>&mdash;Three flat portions of sandstone,
each containing a small hole, opening up on both sides into
funnel-like cavities. The stone here engraved is roughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
circular, about 4 inches in diameter and 1 inch thick. The
cavity at its mouth is about 1 inch in diameter, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> an inch
deep, and communicates with a similar one on the other side
by a hole through which a small goose-quill can just pass.
The holes in the other stones are precisely similar in shape,
only the mouth of the funnel in one is one-third larger, and
in the other about as much less; these differences being
entirely dependent on the thickness of the stone (Fig. <a href="#Page_171">164</a>).</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 164.&mdash;Perforated Sandstone (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>).</p></div>
</div>

<p><em>Pebbles.</em>&mdash;Of these there were several hundreds found,
scattered all over the island, varying in size from half an
inch to 6 or 7 inches in diameter, the larger of which might
have been used as anvils, others as heating-stones, sling-stones,
etc.</p>

<p><em>Querns.</em>&mdash;Out of eleven quern-stones, almost all of which
were made of granite, only two could be positively stated to
be under ones. Three of the upper ones were round coarse
lumps, about 1 foot in diameter and 10 inches deep, and of
these two appear to have been unfinished. One had merely
a cup-shaped cavity on its top, but no hole; and the other,
in addition to the cup, had the central hole partially bored
from both sides. Neither of them had any marginal hole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Four were circular, but rather flatter than usual, and
measured a little over 1 foot in diameter.</p>

<p>One was oval-shaped and particularly well finished,
length 15 inches, breadth 13, and depth 5. The diameter
of the funnel at its mouth was 5 inches, and the lower
portion of it was lengthened in a line with the main axis of
the quern&mdash;evidently caused by the friction of the pivot on
which it turned round. The smaller end, containing the
hole for a handle, was curved downwards, so that its tip was
1<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inch lower than the under surface of the quern; another
striking evidence of the long period the stone had been in
actual use.</p>

is composed of a whitish micaceous stone, quite smooth on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
both surfaces, but has no glossy appearance. It measures

<p>The other, which appears to have been a complete circle, was broken
into several portions, two of which have been recovered. These do not
fit into each other, but they are so similar in composition, thickness,
polish, and size of curvature, that there can be no doubt they belonged
to the same disc. The arc of the larger fragment, which is very nearly
a semicircle, indicates that the diameter of the completed circle would
be 4<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inches. It is made of a hard,
dark, compact stone, highly polished on both sides, and neatly cut at
the circumference. It is a quarter of an inch thick at the edge, but
becomes gradually a shade thicker towards the centre (Fig. <a href="#Page_173">167</a>).</p>

<p><em>Organic Remains.</em>&mdash;At his own request, a selection of the
bones and horns collected during the investigations was
forwarded to the late distinguished and much lamented
Professor Rolleston of Oxford, for examination and comparison
with those from Lochlee, but unfortunately, owing to
the state of his health, he was unable to make a report. I
may state, however, that the <em>osseous remains</em> were very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
similar to those from Lochlee. The bones of the sheep,
amongst which was an entire skull, were proportionately
in greater numbers than either those of the pig or ox.
<em>Horns</em> were very abundant, but included only those of the
red-deer and roe-deer. Judging from the amount of the
remains of shell-fish (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Lit. littorea</i>, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Patella vulgata</i>, and

<p class="p3b"><em>Notice of a Crannog at Barhapple Loch, Glenluce,
Wigtownshire.</em></p>

<p class="center">(By the Rev. <span class="smcap">George Wilson</span>, Glenluce, C.M.S.A. Scot.)</p>

<p>Barhapple Loch, on the farm of Derskelpin, lay a little
to the south of the road from Portpatrick to Dumfries, just
beyond the fourth milestone east from Glenluce, between
two round hills called Derlauchlin and Barhapple, and about
285 feet above the level of the sea. The water-parting is at
Barhapple Hill. The loch was about 1500 feet long, and
1000 feet broad, surrounded by deep peat bog, except on
part of the east shore where it touched Barhapple, and
rested on a bottom of deep soft peat. Although the water
was only a few feet deep, its black colour and the inaccessible
nature of the shore on the west side prevented the discovery
of any trace of lake-dwellings. It was drained in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
the autumn of 1878, and in November of that year Mr.
Shearer, the tenant, told me that a small round patch of
logs and stones had become visible.</p>

<p>On the 15th of October 1880, our President, the Earl of
Stair, assembled a party to explore the crannog. There
were present with him Admiral Sir John C. Dalrymple-Hay,
Bart., M.P., and Sir Herbert E. Maxwell, Bart., M.P., two of
our Vice-Presidents; the Hon. Hugh Dalrymple, Mr. J. Pendarves
Vivian, M.P., Mr. Vans Agnew of Barnbarroch, Mr.
J. Leveson Stewart of Glen Ogil, with Mr. R. W. Cochran-Patrick,
M.P., and myself, the Secretaries of the Association.
Our digging was stopped at a depth of two and a
half or three feet by the influx of water, yet we found
a good deal to interest us. This lake-dwelling, so far as
explored, consists mainly of piles and platforms of wood,
with rough stones at some points. It is about 280 feet
from the west shore, but the gangway had run about 550
feet to the east shore at the foot of Barhapple, where there
is hard ground. It is surrounded by a row of oak piles,
enclosing a space 175 feet long from north to south, and
127 feet broad, and rounded at the angles. While the digging
was going on Sir Herbert Maxwell took these measurements
for me, and Mr. Vivian walked round on the soft
peat and counted the piles in the outer row, of which 134
were visible. There is a slight gap at the west side, and a
larger one on the south side, with the piles on each side of
it more thinly set. An irregular line on the Plan marks
off a part of the enclosure on the east side, which is about
9 inches higher than the rest, and is the only part that can
be walked upon with ease in ordinary weather. After heavy
rain the whole is still inaccessible, owing to the imperfect
outfall of the drainage.</p>

<p>Thirty-one feet from the outside piles towards the south-east,
there was a layer of rough, large stones, marked <span class="smcap">B</span> on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Plate III., about 15 feet long from north to south, and 11 feet
broad. Seventeen feet farther north, and 18 feet from the
east side, there was a spade-shaped platform, with the
convex end to the north, about 26 feet in length and breadth.
The Plan shows its appearance in February 1879, with
several pieces of wood flooring towards the east side, and a
layer of large rough stones at <span class="smcap">A</span>. In October 1880 some of
the logs had rotted away, and others were pierced through by
the shoots of the marsh plants, which are gradually covering
the partially drained area. Thirty feet to the west of <span class="smcap">A</span>,
there was a circular layer of rough stones about 10 feet in
diameter, surrounded by several rings of piles. On removing
some loose dry peat on the east part of <span class="smcap">A</span>, we found a floor
of oak logs, laid north and south, 10 feet 6 inches in length
and 8 feet in breadth. The surface was somewhat flat; but
this may have been caused by exposure to the weather.
The interstices were closely packed with white clay and the
sphagnum moss, so common in our bogs, with a few stakes
driven between them. At the west or inner side of this
floor there was a log 13 feet 6 inches long, 1 foot broad, and
8 inches deep. Beyond it was a layer of large rough stones
from 9 to 12 inches deep, which had been disturbed by some
idle visitors, so that its exact extent cannot be given.
Under the stones was a thin layer of peat, then a log floor
resting on clay and stones, and under that a second floor,
the parts of which were sloping. Under the large oak log
already mentioned lay a few birch logs sloping towards the
north-west, and covering at the left side one angle of a frame
6 feet 6 inches square, made of four oak beams, that on the
south-east side having two square-cut mortise holes, measuring
6 by 5 inches, and 4 feet apart, and that on the opposite
side having one mortise hole with a piece of the upright
still in it. In the angle between this frame and the south
end of the large log there was a circular hearth of rough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
stones bedded in clay, and a similar hearth beyond the
north-west angle, where there seems to have been another
square frame without mortises. There were several inches
in depth of ashes, with charred wood, and fragments of bone
too small and wasted to indicate what animal they belonged
to. West of the second hearth the following section was
noted in descending series:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>(<em>a</em>.) Rough stones, 9 inches.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>.) Peat, 12 inches.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>.) Ashes, 5 inches.</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>.) White clay, 3 or 4 inches.</p>

<p>(<em>e</em>.) Ashes.</p></blockquote>

<p>Under the floor first described there was a layer of smaller
sticks and branches of oak, hazel, and birch, and at the
north-east we found under the branches a layer of the common
bracken, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Pteris aquilina</i>. The influx of water prevented
further examination, but at different places the spade struck
on logs which could not be seen. The wet state of the peat,
ashes, and clay made exact search difficult. Near the second
hearth we found a long rude whetstone, a hammer-stone of
water-rolled quartzite pebble, a fragment of smoothly-worked
wood, 3 inches long, 2 broad, and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> an inch thick, which may
have been part of a ladle or large spoon, and a small branch
like one's little finger, rudely pointed, and with an untrimmed
bent head. When unpacked at the Museum, these
pieces of wood had gone to pieces.</p>

<p>A trench cut from the hearths to <span class="smcap">B</span> showed logs and
stones under the stone floor there, but not in any regular
order. Under the stones, at <span class="smcap">C</span>, we got two broad pieces of oak
about 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> feet long, which may have been parts of a canoe.</p>

<p>Near the beginning of the gangway, at the end of a log,
there rolled from a labourer's spade a ring of unevenly
polished cannel coal, which is shown in Fig. 187, full size.</p>

<p>The piles are pointed, and show the axe-marks distinctly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Two or three branches, 2 inches thick, had been severed by
a single cut. The piles are from 6 to 8 inches thick, but I
saw one a foot thick. One which was pulled up was 5 feet
long. The Plan shows the radiating and curved arrangement
of the piles.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 187.&mdash;Ring of Cannel Coal (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>).</p></div>
</div>

<p>At the south-east of the crannog, a few feet from the
edge, two piles 6 feet apart show where the gangway entered.
Two or three are seen farther off, then about twenty at a place
where the gangway seems to have widened to nearly 12 feet,
and beyond these are two other pairs, the last being about
100 feet from the shore. Beyond that the piles have rotted
away through exposure to the weather in dry seasons. There
are decayed remains of timber at various places round the
shore.</p>

<p>While we were digging at the crannog, Sir Herbert
Maxwell, who is an experienced observer of lake-dwellings,
explored the whole circuit of the loch, and reported that he
had found some logs laid like a corduroy road. I did not
see them at the time, and when I went back frost and flood
had hidden the traces of them. At the letter <span class="smcap">C</span> I have indi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>cated
pretty nearly the spot where they were seen. Perhaps
another platform was there.</p>

<p>In April 1881, when verifying some details, I observed a
few piles at the point marked <span class="smcap">D</span>, between the crannog and
the north shore, and reached them with difficulty. The
nearest is about 120 feet from the shore, and is the first in
a straight line of four piles, set at distances of 6, 10, and
8 feet, with two others 6 and 7 feet to the left, nearly opposite
the second and third. At <span class="smcap">E</span> I have marked the probable
position in the peat bog of an object described by me in
"Notes on the Crannogs and Lake-Dwellings in Wigtownshire,"
in the <cite>Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland</cite>,
vol. ix. page 337,&mdash;"<em>Barhapple Loch</em>, four miles east of
Glenluce, close to the coach road.&mdash;James M&#701;Culloch, one of
my deacons, told me that about the year 1842, in cutting
peat about 40 yards from the west side of this loch, he came
on a circle of stakes (about a dozen) from the thickness of
the arm to that of the leg, and about 5 feet long; the heads
at least 2 feet below the surface. The stakes were of hazel,
pointed by four axe-cuts, 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> to 4 inches broad, and some of
them 5 inches long. The circle was cut away at two times,
and was at least 5 feet in diameter; coarse branches were
twisted among the stakes like wicker-work. No trace of
clay." In 1871 I reported this as indicating that some dwellings
might yet be found in this loch. It seems to have been
a <em>marsh</em>-dwelling, like some of those found near lakes in
Switzerland.</p>

<p>The crannogs were probably used as places of refuge,
although they may also have been occupied constantly.
There is often a fort on the top of some neighbouring hill, to
which the lake-dwellers may have gone when the lochs were
frozen and the crannogs open to invasion. We have an
example of this at Machermore, Glenluce. The two round
hills between which Barhapple Loch lay have both been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
ploughed, and show no trace of fortification or dwellings.
But beyond Barhapple, and half a mile eastward, on the
farm of Barlea, a small knoll south of Barfad rises out of
the bog like a peninsula. It is nameless on the Ordnance
Survey Maps, but on an old map of Blairderry and Barlea,
which must be above a hundred years old, it is called <em>Drumearnachan</em>.
There are traces here of an old village or
settlement, although it has been partially ploughed. At
the lowest part of Barfad there is a ring of turf and stone
17 by 16 feet in diameter. 138 feet to the south are the
remains of a wall or breast-work 126 feet long and 12 broad.
Beyond it several foundations are seen in a straight line
north and south. At 96 feet is the bottom of a cairn 30 feet
long and 22 broad, and 40 feet to the left of it a roughly-paved
circular floor, 6 feet in diameter, which has been saved
from the plough by having a large boulder rolled on to it.
Thirty-six feet beyond the cairn is a 9-feet circular foundation
of stones; 26 feet farther on an oval lying across
the line, 15 by 13 feet; 8 feet farther on, an 11-foot ring;
59 feet beyond that, a small circular patch of stones; and
another, 45 feet farther on, with a low grassy cairn 10 feet
in diameter, 36 feet off at the west. Sixty-two feet south-east
from the last foundation in the straight row is a circular
turf and stone ring, 10<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> feet thick, 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> high, and 48 feet in
diameter over all, with the entrance-gap at the <em>south-west</em>.
On the 6-inch Ordnance Map it is marked "site of cairn,"
but I have never found any one who had heard of a cairn
there. Part of the enclosed space is somewhat stony, and
the position of the entrance-gap is peculiar, all the others I
have seen or heard of having it at the south-east. Many
years ago, the late tenant, Mr. M&#701;Ilwraith of Kilfillan, asked
me to go and see this ring, because he thought it had been
surrounded by two oval rows of earth-fast stones. I went
and made careful measurements, with this result, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
stones <em>may</em> have been arranged in order, but there has been
too much disturbance by the plough to make this more than
a guess. For a long time I regarded such rings as small
forts; but have lately begun to think they may have been
places of interment. I have heard of three instances in
which the plough, in levelling down such rings, turned up
crocks of coarse pottery, not in the enclosed space, but in the
rings themselves. The attention of observers elsewhere is
called to this fact.</p>

<p>BARHAPPLE LOCH GLENLUCE 1881</p></div>
</div>

<p>Half a mile due north from the Barhapple crannog, passing
Knockiecore, Barrel Hill, and Derniemore Hill on the
left, and Tamrieroach Moss, Derhagie Hill, and Blairderry
Hill on the right, just beyond the old military road, we
reach a low rocky hill surrounded by a peat bog, which
unfortunately has lost its ancient name, and is called from
its broad shape the Braid Hill. It is on the farm of High
Dergoals; and Mr. Dougan, the tenant, told me that many
years ago he found, in cutting peat at the south side of it,
at a depth of 4 feet, three or four stakes, apparently of oak,
3 or 4 inches in circumference, and pointed by a single cut.
The higher ground is rocky and uneven, and scattered over
it are the remains of several small cairns and rings. At
the west end is a 10-foot ring, a cairn with the remains of
a stone grave in the centre, and beyond it two others lying
east and west, with a foundation between them, 27 by 14
feet, with the corners much rounded. Towards the middle
there are two circular foundations, three others on the north
slope, three on the south, and three more at the east end, all
so indistinct that it is difficult to say whether they have
been huts or cairns. On the slope at the east end there are
two rings. It is impossible to know whether either of these
sites has been occupied by the Barhapple lake-dwellers.
There are no others near it, although there are several other
ancient village sites in Glenluce, some of which I hope to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
describe in a future volume. There have been four other
lochs in Old Luce parish with crannogs. The frequent
occurrence of the syllables <em>der</em>, <em>dir</em>, or <em>dar</em>, in the names of
the places near Barhapple, shows that long ago they were
clothed with trees. Here is a topographic rhyme, by some
unknown native bard, communicated to me by Mr. Thomas
M&#701;Cormick, farmer at Mindork, in Kirkcowan:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p3b"><em>Notice of the Excavation of a Crannog at Buston,
near Kilmaurs.</em></p>

<p><em>Discovery of the Crannog.</em>&mdash;About half-way between
Stewarton and Kilmaurs there is, on the farm of Mid Buston,
the property of the Earl of Eglinton, a shallow basin, now
converted into a richly cultivated meadow, but which
formerly, as represented in Bleau's <em>Atlas</em>, formed the bed of
a lake of considerable size called Loch Buston. Within the
recollection of the present generation this area was a mossy
bog in summer and a sheet of water in winter; and about
fifty years ago, when the present tenant, Mr. Robert Hay,
came to reside on the farm, there was a small mound or
island situated about its centre, locally known as the <em>Swan
Knowe</em>, on account of the numbers of wild swans that
formerly used to frequent it. When subsequently engaged
in reclaiming the bog, Mr. Hay states that as many as thirteen
cart-loads of timber were removed from the "Knowe,"
and he distinctly remembers that, in consequence of the
difficulty of detaching some of the beams mortised into
others, his father then made the remark, "there maun hae<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
been dwallers here at ae time." He also states that until
the land was thoroughly redrained, some five years ago,
there was still a considerable mound to be seen; but at the
beginning of December 1880, when I first visited the locality,
there was hardly any elevation to distinguish it from the
surrounding field. Notwithstanding Mr. Hay's knowledge
of the structure of the "Knowe," which he supposed to have
been erected by one of the old Earls for the purpose of facilitating
the shooting of wild-ducks&mdash;a purpose for which it
had frequently served himself,&mdash;the merit of detecting here
the ruins of an ancient lake-dwelling is due to Mr. D.
M&#701;Naught, schoolmaster of Kilmaurs. The history of the
discovery is most interesting, and reflects much credit on
the discoverer; but the story is best told by himself.
Having a faint recollection that Mr. M&#701;Naught was one of
a group of critical sceptics who visited Lochlee while the
investigations there were in progress, and maintained that
the crannog was merely the site of an old "whisky still," I
was curious to know the circumstances and exact process of
ratiocination which had now actually culminated in placing
him in the position of being a discoverer in this same line
of research; so, after the importance of the crannog had
been established by some valuable "finds," I wrote a note
asking if he would kindly oblige me by a written statement
of whatever information he could supply on the subject.
The following is his reply:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">Kilmaurs</span>, <cite>January 15th, 1881</cite>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have much pleasure in replying to yours
received this morning.</p>

<p>"About five years ago, when engaged in levelling the large
drain that passes Buiston crannog, I passed over the very spot,
but being utterly ignorant on the subject I noticed nothing
peculiar. When passing through the stackyard on my way home
I noticed the old beams, but on being told that they were from
some old house I thought no more of the matter. The subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
had so completely escaped my memory that even when I had
seen the Lochlee beams they failed to recall what had formerly
arrested my attention at Buiston. My scepticism at Lochlee
arose from the fact that I failed to trace the shape and construction
of the crannog as detailed in <cite>Chambers's Encyclopædia</cite>,
which was the only authority then at my disposal.</p>

<p>"I never heard anything more of the Buiston crannog till the
week of the discovery. Talking with one of the farmers in my
own house, the conversation turned on furniture, when bog-oak
was mentioned. He remarked that there was as much lying in
Buiston stackyard as would stock the parish. At once I remembered
what I had formerly seen, and though the recollection was
hazy, on afterthought I felt almost sure that I had noticed
mortised holes, and that <em>the beams were identical with those I had
seen at Lochlee</em>. Next day, as soon as I had closed the school I
went up to the farm. Mr. Hay was inclined to pooh-pooh the
matter, and said that the place was 'juist a timmer house ane o'
the auld Earls had put up to shoot deuks.' Going out to the
stackyard I found that the ricks had been built on the old
timber, which made excellent 'bottoms.' I looked about for
an odd bit, and did eventually get a splinter, but not sufficient
for identification. After getting rid of the old man, his youngest
son and I set to work at the bottom of one of the ricks, and
pulled one of the beams so far out as enabled me to saw off the
mortised joint. This I sent to the <cite>Standard</cite> office, where you
saw it on the Saturday morning following. I then went down
to the site of the crannog, but it had become so dark that I had
to feel my way. I eventually kicked against something which
seemed to be an upright sticking through the soil. I went up
next morning early, and when I had seen the three uprights
afterwards pointed out to you, and the mortised beams stuck in
the side of the drain, I no longer had any doubts. I therefore
at once wrote to Mr. Cochran-Patrick, and penned a cautious
intimation for the <cite>Standard</cite>, which the editor accepted on trust
from me. You know the rest.&mdash;Yours truly, <span class="shiftright">"D. <span class="smcap">M&#701;Naught</span>.</span></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dr. Munro</span>."</p></blockquote>

<p>On the afternoon of the Saturday referred to in the
above letter (December 4th, 1880), I accompanied Mr.
M&#701;Naught to the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">quondam</i> "Knowe," and in a short time, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
a few tentative diggings, the existence here of the remains
of a crannog was put beyond a doubt. Our Secretary,
R. W. Cochran-Patrick, Esq., M.P., who had already been
communicated with, then brought the matter under the
notice of the Honourable G. R. Vernon, Auchans, as Commissioner
for the Earl of Eglinton; and after due deliberation
it was agreed to make an immediate investigation of
the crannog on behalf of the proprietor. Accordingly, on
the 10th December 1880, six men were started to work in
presence of Mr. Vernon, Mr. Cochran-Patrick, and several
ladies and gentlemen interested in the discovery. It is
needless to describe the subsequent management of the
excavations. The peculiar and absorbing interest excited
by the variety of the finds during the first few days soon
developed the true spirit of inquiry among all concerned,
and even the old and highly-respected farmer gave up his
long-cherished theory of the "duck-shooting," and ultimately
rendered valuable aid by protecting the trenches from
the prying curiosity of the general public, and picking
up relics from the stuff wheeled out, which became visible
by long exposure to weather and heavy rains. By general
consent, at least <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">nem. con.</i>, I was appointed custodier of the
relics; and now, acting on the old saying that possession is
nine points of the law, I have assumed the rôle of historian.</p>

<p><em>Method of Excavating.</em>&mdash;The excavations were commenced
by making an explorative trench through what appeared to
be the centre of the crannog, following as a guide the long
diameter of the lake basin. This trench was from 2 to 3
feet deep, and about 5 feet wide, and its general direction
lay in a line running from <span class="smcap">N.W.</span> to <span class="smcap">S.E.</span> The débris was
wheeled sufficiently far not to cover the probable area of
the island, and carefully examined, but nothing of importance
was found, except a small spindle whorl (Fig. 196),
and a fragment of a quern-stone, till the trench reached the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
southern margin of the crannog. Here, after the tops of
a few upright piles were exposed, a large beam was encountered,
lying right across the trench, beyond which the
stuff turned up from the bottom consisted almost entirely
of broken bones and ashes. This was at once recognised
as the wished-for midden, and its discovery at this early
stage was fortunate, inasmuch as its examination would
soon decide, with a trifling outlay, the quality of the crannog
as a relic depôt. To this, therefore, attention was exclusively
devoted, till the severity of the weather compelled us
to abandon working altogether. The depth of clay and soil
above the midden was about 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> feet, and after removing
this, its remaining contents were wheeled to a separate
place, so as to facilitate a more careful inspection after
exposure to winter weather. The large number of rare
and valuable relics discovered during the ten days the men
were thus employed induced the Earl of Eglinton to sanction
a further outlay in the prosecution of these researches; and
it was then agreed that nothing less than the removal of the
débris over the whole area of the crannog would satisfy
archæological demands. The tenant also very kindly consented
to leave this portion of his field untilled, so that
there was no necessity to resume work till the weather
became really suitable for such an undertaking.</p>

<p>Early in April very dry weather, though cold, set in,
and on the farmer representing that more favourable circumstances
for digging could not be expected, the investigation
of the crannog was resumed.</p>

<p>While clearing out the refuse-heap, the position of the
surrounding piles immediately to the left of the original
trench was readily ascertained to be arranged in three or
four circles. With these as guides, it was an easy matter
for the workmen to clear away the soil right round the
central portion of the crannog without the necessity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
constant supervision. The surface soil, which consisted of
fine clay, varying in depth from about 6 inches at the centre
of the mound to 2 feet beyond the outer circle of stockades,
was first wheeled away, and, as no relics were expected here,
there was no time wasted in searching for them. Afterwards
the dark heterogeneous under stratum of débris was
carefully removed from above the wood-work and examined,
though not with the same care as the contents of the refuse-heap.
Here, however, a few important relics were discovered,
among which are an ornamented gold spiral finger-ring,
a small earthen crucible, and some fragments of pottery.
Having completed this broad annular trench, the débris
remaining on the central portion was taken away, but,
contrary to expectation, nothing was found in it beyond
the evidence of a few fireplaces, some slag, and one or two
large wooden pins.</p>

</div>

<p><em>Structure of Island.</em>&mdash;Notwithstanding the havoc committed
on the wood-work of the crannog by long exposure
to atmospheric agencies before it finally sunk under the
protective influence of the muddy water, and subsequently,
by the ruthless hands of the agriculturist, there still remained
sufficient materials to give one not only a general, but
particular and instructive notion of the mechanical principles
on which the island was constructed. Its substance, as far
as could be ascertained by digging holes here and there, was
made up of layers of the stems of trees, chiefly birch;
intermingled with which were occasionally found various
other materials, such as brushwood, heather, moss, soil, and
large stones. Penetrating deeply this heterogeneous mass,
towards its margin, were numerous piles, forming a series
of concentric and nearly circular stockades, which were
separated from each other by an interval of 4 or 5 feet.
On the south side there were four distinct circles to be
seen, but on the north only three could be detected, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
third outermost appeared to have merged into the external
one; and, in accordance with this diminished number of
circles, the breadth of the stockaded zone also diminished.
The piles in the inner circle, which were strongly made, and
showed evidence of having been shaped and squared by
sharp-cutting instruments, were uniformly arranged at a
distance of from 4 to 5 feet, and enclosed an area more of
the form of an ellipse than a circle (measuring 61 feet
by 56), while those in the second and third circles were
more irregularly, but generally more closely, set. All these
uprights (except a few on the north side of the inner circle)
were linked together by horizontal beams having square-cut
holes, through which the upper ends of the piles passed.
The horizontal beams were arranged in two ways. Some
lay along the circumference and bound together all the
uprights in the same circle to each other, while others took
the radial position and connected each circle together. Some
of the latter were long enough to embrace three circles, and
when this was the case I have noticed that the upright in
the middle circle was sometimes firmly caught in a deep
cut in the transverse, instead of passing through a mortised
hole (see Fig. 190). Although the uprights in the inner
circle were not linked together circumferentially along the
whole course of the horizontal beams, the particular construction
of the log pavement on the north side rendering
this unnecessary, every one of them had a radial beam,
directed from within outwards, which kept it from yielding
to lateral pressure. This purpose was equally well served
in several ways; sometimes the inner end of the radial beams
pressed tightly against the upright, at other times the former
projected half-way into the log pavement, where its end
was firmly fixed by a thick pin passing through it into the
under structures of the island, and its middle contained
either a notch or mortised hole for holding the latter in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
position. The external ends of these radial beams were
occasionally observed to be continuous with additional
strengthening materials, such as wooden props and large
stones.</p>

<p>The main object of the whole of this elaborate structural
system was to give stability to the island, afford fixed points
on its surface, and prevent the superincumbent pressure of
whatever buildings may have been erected over it from
causing the general mass to bulge outwards&mdash;objects which
appeared to have been most effectually attained.</p>

<p>The piles in the outer circle were merely round posts,
smaller and more closely placed than those in the inner
circles, being sometimes only a few inches apart, and
appeared to have been bound together by a transverse rail,
into which their tops were inserted after the manner of a
hurdle. Portions of these rails, pierced with holes, were
found at the south-east side, though none actually in position;
so that the inference that the outer stockade was
intended as a fence or bulwark seems quite legitimate. In
support of this view I may state that nowhere along its
course were the piles connected together by horizontal
beams, either circumferentially or radially, nor did they
penetrate deeply, so that for giving stability to the island
the outer circle would be of little use.</p>

<p><em>Log Pavement.</em>&mdash;Like the other crannogs examined by
me, this one also had its central portion roughly paved with
wooden beams like railway sleepers. On looking at these
beams carefully it was observed that many of them, especially
those made of oak, had also holes at their extremities,
and that the plan of being linked and fixed together by
stout wooden pins was by no means peculiar to the marginal
portion of the crannog. Here, however, they lay mostly in
a radial position, and on the south side; some were distinctly
seen to be joined with the uprights in the inner circle with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
one end, while the outer, which pointed to the centre, was
firmly pinned to the wood below. In several parts this
general network of large beams was covered over by a
pavement made of small round logs, mostly of birch, and
placed close together, but, being soft and easily removed,
I could not be certain whether or not it extended over the
whole area. If so, it must have been a secondary pavement
formed after the crannog was inhabited, as marks of fire,
with slag and ashes, were found in two or three places lying
immediately on the large oak beams below it.</p>

<p>On the north side of the crannog the uprights in the
inner circle were not linked together circumferentially by
horizontal beams, because (as I have already remarked) the
different structure of the log pavement here rendered this
plan unnecessary. The reason of this was, that on this side
a considerable segment of the log pavement was built up,
for a depth of 2 feet or so, of several layers of those round
logs of soft wood, laid transversely to each other, and carefully
arranged flush with the outer edge of the uprights,
so that the only direction in which the latter were free was
counteracted by the radial transverses alone (see Fig. 190).</p>

<p>The space between this portion of the log pavement and
the next circle of stockades was filled up with layers of turf
and moss, the depth of which corresponded with that of the
built-up edge of the log pavement. After removing the turf
and moss from this space in one or two places, we came on
the wood of the island, which here consisted entirely of
birch-trees with the bark on, and looking as fresh as if they
had been recently cut. The heather and moss also looked
quite fresh, but soon, after exposure to the air, everything
turned black. (See Plate IV.)</p>

<p><em>Remains of Dwelling-house.</em>&mdash;Over the area of the log
pavement there were here and there the remains of large
uprights, which appeared to have been used as supports for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
some sort of dwelling-house. On the north side, a few feet
from the margin of the log pavement, there were three or
four of these, as if forming another circle, one of which I
extracted with difficulty and found it to be 8 feet long, 7 of
which were imbedded in the structure of the island. It was
neatly formed of a rectangular shape (10 inches by 6), and
its downward end was cut and pointed as if for insertion into
a mortised hole. The centre of the log pavement was occupied
by a mass of ashes, charcoal, and stones, forming a bed
about 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> feet thick, being nearly the entire depth of the
mound above the wood-work, and a little to the west of this,
and situated between two large square-shaped uprights,
there was a thin bed of charcoal and burnt straw, together
with some flat stones covered with a quantity of slag. On
the east side, near the circle of piles, conclusive evidence of
another fireplace was observed, but no well-formed hearths
were anywhere met with.</p>

</div>


<p>On tracing the inner circle of stockades all round, it
became evident that they formed part of some sort of enclosure.
On the south-east side were two well-shaped rectangular
uprights, about 2 feet 6 inches high, and 4 feet
apart, firmly mortised into a well-constructed wooden flooring.
These, as will appear from the sequel, formed portions
of the door-posts of the entrance to the area of log pavement.
Continuous with them, on the east side, and in the line of
the inner circle, some of the intervals between the uprights
were actually found to contain the remains of a composite
wall of stone and wood. The space between the second and
third piles, counting from the doorway, was thus filled up.
At the base there were two layers of rectangular stones, then
a flat beam of oak laid horizontally, then three layers of thin
flagstones, well selected for size and shape, then another oak
beam similar to the first, and finally other three layers of
flat stones. This wall had partially fallen over, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
relative position of the respective layers was still retained,
and showed that when standing it would be about 3 feet
high (see Fig. 189). The adjoining space, next the doorway,
had two layers of stones at the base, and then a beam, but
the rest was wanting. There were no further remains of
a decided wall met with, though stones were abundantly
encountered all over the area of the crannog. As all the
uprights in the inner circle appeared to have been worn or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
broken, there is no evidence to show what their former
height was, but as they now stand, they are not only different
in shape, but considerably taller than those in the
second and third circles, which are all shorter and more or
less pointed.</p>

second circle of piles dug out, showing arrangement of Transverse Beams
and structure of the Log Pavement. (<cite>From Photograph by Mr. Lawrie.</cite>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>Directly facing the door-place, but 13 feet farther out,
and nearly in a line with the outer circle of stockades, there
was a large rectangularly-shaped beam 11 feet long, containing
two mortised holes, one at each end, and having an
interval of 8 feet 6 inches between them. This beam lay
close to two massive uprights which projected about 2 feet
above the surface of the wooden flooring, and, both as regards
distance and shape, looked as if they had been mortised into
the holes in the former. When the beam was thus applied
and restored into its natural position, the portion of its under
side between the mortised holes was observed to have a
longitudinal groove, having its inner margin bevelled off, and
containing a few round holes, which, however, did not penetrate
to its upper surface, and just underneath it were the
external ends of two large oak planks, which extended
inwards to the doorway. On careful inspection these planks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
were also found to contain a few vertical holes, so that it
became apparent that the interval between them and the
large transverse was protected by a series of upright wooden
spars. External to this parapet-like arrangement was the
refuse-heap, which, on being entirely cleared away, showed
that the two uprights, though exposed to a depth of about
6 feet below the wooden pavement, were immovably fixed.
Close to one of them deeper digging was attempted, with
the view of getting an idea of its length, and at a depth of
4 feet still lower a solid beam could be felt with an iron
probe; but whether the upright was mortised into it I could
not determine. Continuous with the east end of this ashpit
railing was the external circle of stockades, which curved
a little outwards, and at the other end, in addition to an
external line of slender stockades which took a more rapid
sweep outwards, there was a straight row of uprights thickly
placed together, and protected at their base by a strong fixed
beam, into which they were mortised (see Fig. 188). This
beam was on a lower level than the platform in front of the
doorway, and the upper ends of the uprights were free, but
the probability is that originally they were bound by a transverse
rail. On the inner side of this line a number of short
beams were observed lying flat, as if they had been intended
for a pathway, and towards its external end there lay a confused
heap of slender beams projecting beyond the line of
the outer stockades. It was this peculiarity that suggested
this spot as the probable terminus of an under-water gangway
leading to the shore, the determination of which led to
the making of a trench some 12 feet farther out, which
resulted in the discovery of a canoe.</p>

<p>Though nothing in the arrangement of the wooden structures
here could be construed to indicate a regular landing-stage,
it was very probable, from its southern exposure, the
position of the canoe, and the proximity of the doorway to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
the log pavement, together with the pathway leading up to
it, that this really was the ordinary landing-place as well as
the outer entrance to the crannog.</p>

<p><em>Refuse-heap.</em>&mdash;As mentioned above, the refuse-heap lay
outside the stockades, and immediately beyond the railing
in front of the supposed doorway to the central area of the
crannog. It was of an oblong shape, measuring from 25
to 30 feet long (along the margin of the island), and about
15 to 20 feet across. Its depth, near the railing, would be
about 5 feet in addition to its superficial layer of clay and
silt. The principal ingredients of its central portion were
broken bones and ashes, but towards the margin and lower
strata these were largely mixed with decayed brushwood.
To clear out its deeper portions was a difficult matter,
owing to the rapid accumulation of water. One of the
combs (Fig. 218), and a bone pin, were found here in my
presence, at a depth of not less than 6 or 7 feet below the
surface of the field. The lowest stratum reached consisted
of what seemed to me to be lake silt, brushwood, and some
large bones. The bones, especially those from the lower
strata, were abundantly impregnated with the mineral
vivianite, which, in some of the larger ones, formed groups
of most beautiful green crystals, similar in all respects to
those found at the Lochlee crannog. What, however, made
the investigation of the midden so full of interest was the
number of rare and valuable relics recovered from its contents.
Some of them were picked up <em>in situ</em>, when the men
were wheeling out the stuff, but others were subsequently
found by riddling the débris when it became sufficiently dry
to admit of this process.</p>

<p>The general results of the above observations may be
categorically summed up as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The island, as far as could be ascertained from the investigations
made, was composed of a succession of layers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the trunks and branches of trees, intermingled in some places
with stones, turf, etc.</p>

<p>2. The whole mass was kept firmly together by a peculiar
arrangement of upright and horizontal beams, forming a
united series of circular stockades.</p>

<p>3. The outer circle was intended more for protection than
for giving stability to the island, and in some parts, as at the
east side of refuse-heap, was neatly constructed after the
manner of a stair-railing, while the inner one not only gave
stability to the island, but was used as a fence, or in connection
with the superstructural buildings.</p>

<p>4. The central portion was rudely paved with wooden
beams, many of which were firmly fixed to the lower wood-work
by stout wooden pegs as well as to the encircling
stockades, thus affording here and there, as it were, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">points
d'appui</i>.</p>

<p>5. While there was one general fireplace situated near
the centre, evidence of occasional fires elsewhere was quite
conclusive, one of which appeared to have been a smelting-furnace.</p>

<p>6. The entrance to the central area was looking south-east,
and in front of it there was a well-constructed wooden
platform, made of large oak planks, supported on solid
layers of wood to which they were pinned down.</p>

<p>7. Beyond the platform, but separated from it by a
massive wooden railing, was the refuse-heap; and to the
right of it a pathway, also protected on its outer side by a
railing, led downwards and westwards to the line of the outer
circle, where there appeared to have been an opening towards
a rude landing-stage at the water edge.</p>

<p>8. As to the kind of dwelling-house that no doubt once
occupied this site, whether one large pagoda-like building
or a series of small huts, the evidence is inconclusive, but so
far as it goes it appears to me to be indicative of the former.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
In addition to what has already been stated, there remains
to notice only a few broken pieces of wood containing round
holes, together with a variety of large and small pins similar
to those described and figured in my notice of the Lochlee
crannog.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><em>Discovery and Description of Canoe.</em>&mdash;The experience derived
from the investigations of the crannogs at Lochlee and
Lochspouts, in both of which a submerged gangway was
found running to the nearest shore, was sufficiently suggestive
to keep me on the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">qui vive</i> for any indications of a
similar structure here. On the north side, where the shore
was nearest, though the digging was carried considerably
deeper and farther out from the margin of the crannog than
elsewhere, not the slightest appearance of outlying wood-work
was observed; and as there was no probability of an approach
from the more distant ends of the lake, the situation of a gangway,
if such existed at all, was limited to the south-west side,
where the shore would be about 150 yards distant. To determine
this, the men were set to cut a trench about 12 yards
distant from the crannog, across the most likely line, so as to
intercept it, and after going down 4 feet they came upon a
layer of brushwood, along with one or two beams, below
which there seemed to be the usual lake mud. Upon
forcing the spade downwards, however, a hard beam was
encountered, which at first I took to be the discovery of part
of the gangway we were in search of, and to satisfy myself
on the point I took an iron rod, and, by carefully probing all
over the bottom of the trench, ascertained that instead of a
gangway we had come upon portion of a canoe. Guided by
the direction of the supposed side of the canoe, which looked
like a thin oak beam running along the edge of the trench, a
suitable clearance was made, which revealed to the wondering
gaze of the bystanders the front half of a large canoe.
Upon being subsequently exposed in its entirety it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
found to have the following dimensions and peculiarities.
Its sides were supported by a series of well-shaped ribs,
which extended from the rim to near the mesial line, and
sometimes a little beyond it. This, at first sight, gave the
canoe the appearance of a boat, but after careful inspection
it became apparent that these ribs were no part of the
original vessel, but subsequent additions made for repairing
and strengthening purposes. Nearly the whole of one side
was lined with broad thin boards made of soft wood, external
to which was the thin oak side of the canoe, having its
cracks as well as the intermediate spaces between it and the
strengthening boards actually stuffed with a species of moss.
Moreover, the ribs on this side were more numerous than on
the other side, no less than ten having been observed on the
former, and their arrangement on both sides was totally
devoid of regularity. Of the whole series of ribs only two
were made of oak, the rest being of birch or some perishable
wood, and so decayed that it was with great care they were
prevented from being entirely destroyed by the workmen,
as they offered no resistance to their spades. They were
fastened to the canoe by wooden pins, arranged generally in
couples forming two rows along the rib, and so closely were
they placed that not less than sixteen were counted in one
rib. In two places the canoe had been repaired by inserting
a nicely fitting piece of oak planking instead of the original
portion of the side. One of these patches measured 2 feet
3 inches long, and 10 inches broad, and was kept in position
by two ribs, one near each end. The stem, which was
symmetrically shaped and pointed, was pierced horizontally
by a large hole, and about 3 feet from its tip each side had
also an elongated hole near the rim, sufficiently large to
admit of being easily grasped by the hand. Externally, and
on both sides, there was fastened to the edge of the canoe,
by means of wooden pins, a sort of gunwale, which extended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
from within a few feet of the stem till it projected a little
beyond the stern. Close to the stern, two slender bars of
wood, a few inches apart, stretched across, and after passing
through the edges of the canoe terminated in being tightly
mortised into the gunwale. These transverses contained
two round holes similarly arranged as to position, being
near the right side, and between them was inserted a moveable
sternpiece which was shaped to the curve of the canoe,
<em>i.e.</em> approximately a semicircle, and made to fit into a shallow
groove cut out of the solid wood. This sternpiece was
strongly constructed, being 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches thick, 3 feet 6 inches
long, and 1 foot 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches deep about the middle. About
15 inches in advance of the sternpiece there was a ridge
across the bottom and sides of the canoe which looked like
a rib, but was really part of the solid oak, evidently left for
a special purpose. I also noticed one or two round holes
in the floor, as well as others along its upper edge as if for
thole-pins. In two places equidistant from the ends, and
about 4 feet apart, the gunwale had short pieces of wood
fastened to it by vertical pins, as if intended for the use of
oars. Amongst the decayed brushwood lying across the
canoe was an oak beam, having one end projecting so much
beyond the edge into the clay bank that the workmen in
endeavouring to pull it out broke off the free end. This
portion was rectangularly shaped, 5 inches by 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>, and had
its narrow side pierced with three round holes 1 foot 10
inches apart, which still contained the remains of broken
pins. The shell of the canoe was oak, made by scooping
out the interior of a large trunk, but all its attachments,
such as gunwale, sternpiece, cross spars at stern, and all
the ribs except two, were made of a much less durable
wood.</p>

<p>The extreme length of the canoe was 22 feet, but the
inside measurements were as follows:&mdash;Length 19 feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
6 inches; breadth at stern 3 feet 6 inches; ditto, about
the middle, 4 feet; and ditto, near the stem, 2 feet 10
inches; depth, about centre, 1 foot 10 inches.</p>

<p>Among the mud removed from the hull of the canoe
were a few stones and portion of the skull of an ox (see
Fig. 191).</p>

<p><em>Oar.</em>&mdash;Portion of what appeared to have been a large oar
was found on the crannog, but, from its fragmentary state,
we could only ascertain that the blade was 9 inches broad
and 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inch thick, and that the handle measured 5 inches
in circumference.</p>


<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">Description of Relics.</span></p>

<p>The relics are here grouped under several heads, in
accordance with the method of classification adopted in
my previous monographs, and, to save repetition, I may
explain, that (when not otherwise stated) they may be considered
to have been found either <em>in situ</em> in the refuse-heap,
or among its stuff after it was wheeled out and subsequently
examined.</p>

<p><em>Hammer-Stones</em>, <em>Polishers</em>, <em>etc.</em>&mdash;Only two or three typical
hammer-stones have to be recorded as found on this crannog.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
One is an elongated flat pebble, and shows the usual markings
at both ends, another only at one extremity, and a third
is somewhat circular, with the markings on the flat surface
alone. Under the category of polishers are included seven
or eight highly polished water-worn pebbles, varying much
in size and shape. Two, shaped like pebbles, are 7 inches
long, and have slight pounding marks at both extremities
(Fig. 192). Three are flat and oblong, and measure from
2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> to 4 inches.</p>

<p><em>Sling-Stones</em>, <em>etc.</em>&mdash;Like the hammer-stones, these objects
are comparatively rare, only a few having been added to the
collection.</p>

<p><em>Whetstones</em>, <em>Grindstones</em>, <em>etc.</em>&mdash;Of these objects the following
are noteworthy:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. A large flat implement, made of bluish claystone, with
a smooth polished surface, and having a hole roughly cut
out of one end. It measures 12 inches long, 4 broad, and
1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inch thick (Fig. 193).</p>

</div>

<p>2. One or two ordinary whetstones a few inches long,
and from 1 to 2 inches broad.</p>

<p>3. An oblong block of sandstone, containing two smooth
cavities, probably used for polishing small objects such as
jet rings. One of the cavities is a hollowed circle 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
in diameter, and half an inch deep; the other is a groove
3 inches long, half an inch wide, and the same in depth
(Fig. 194).</p>

<p>4. Two fragments of a circular grindstone, made of fine red
sandstone. One of the portions shows a few inches of the striated
circumference as well as a small segment of the central hole. The
diameter of the stone when whole would be about 15 inches.</p>

</div>

<p>5. Two large irregularly-shaped masses of whitish sandstone, each
containing a smooth cavity shaped like a trowel or botanical spud,
having the sides curled up. One of these curiously-shaped cavities
measures 10 by 8 inches. Its greatest depth, which is at the base
and in the line of the shortest diameter, is 3 inches. The other is
precisely similar in shape, but of smaller dimensions. The latter stone
has friction-marks on another of its sides.</p>

<p>6. Another mass of whitish sandstone, of a semi-globular
shape, having a cup-shaped cavity on its flat surface, must
also be included under this heading. The diameter of the
cup is 5<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches, and its depth 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches. The rest of the
flat surface all round the margin of the cup is smoothed and
striated, evidently caused by the sharpening of tools. The
cup itself was not used for this purpose, as the marks of the
puncheon by which it was chiselled out are distinctly seen.
Its probable use was to hold water, so essential to the
sharpening of metal tools.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Cup Stone.</em>&mdash;A small cup stone found in the interior of the
crannog. The stone is smooth on its upper and under surfaces and on
one side, but the other sides are irregularly shaped. The cup itself
is quite smooth and circular, and looks as if it had been used as a
small mortar. Its diameter is only 1 inch, and depth half an inch (Fig.

fragmentary condition. One was made of a fine quartz conglomerate, and,
by putting the fragments together, it was ascertained that it measured
18 inches by 17 inches. It was flat, and more of a millstone shape, and
the central hole was large (3 inches in diameter), circular, and not
tapering. For the insertion of a handle there was a small square-shaped

<p><em>Spindle Whorls.</em>&mdash;A small spindle whorl neatly made of
coarse shale. It is flat and circular, and has a diameter of

(Fig. 197).</p>

<p><em>Flint Objects.</em>&mdash;Two views of a portion of a curved flint
knife, which has been much used, are here given (Fig. 198).
Another small flint implement like a scraper is figured,
because it exhibits one side which has been artificially
polished (Fig. 199). Fig. 200 represents a small central
core, neatly chipped all round. There is another large core
of flint 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inches in diameter, from which many flakes
appear to have been struck off. Besides the above there
were found a small portion of a finely chipped scraper, and
a large quantity of broken flints and chips.</p>

and a large quartz crystal having its angles worn off, may
be mentioned among the nondescript articles under this

middle of the first trench, but, mysteriously, it could not be
seen when collecting the objects at the end of the day's
work, and was never recovered.</p>

with round polished stems, tapering into sharp points.
Some have round heads like beads, others are circular but
flat on the top, while others again, especially the larger ones,
are irregularly shaped. One (Fig. 202) has its head ornamented
by a circular ridge, surmounted by a wider rim
neatly notched all round, and another has its shank surrounded
by two bands of diamond-shaped spaces, formed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>

</div>

<p>They are all made on a uniform plan. The body, <em>i.e.</em>
the portion containing the teeth, consists of three or four flat
pieces kept in position by two transverse bands of bone, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
on each side, and riveted together by three or four iron rivets.
The comb represented by Fig. 217 has its body made of four
portions, but only three rivets. The ornamentation is alike
on both sides, and at one end there is a small hole, probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
for attaching it to a string. It is 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches long and 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inches
broad. That figured next (Fig. 218) has the same breadth
as the former, but not quite the same length, being only
3 inches long. The ornamentation is similar on both sides.</p>

<p>From slight cuts on the cross bars, corresponding to the
intervals between the teeth, it is manifest that the teeth in
both these combs were formed by a saw, after the pieces were
riveted together.</p>

<p>The third comb here engraved (Fig. 219) is in a somewhat
fragmentary condition, but when whole it would be
about 4 inches long. The body was made up of four portions,
and contained four iron rivets. Its ornamentation
consists of a central dot, surrounded by two incised circles,
and is alike on both sides. The similarity of the concentric
circles induces me to believe that they must have
been formed by a die, probably branded on with a hot iron.</p>

<p>Some other fragments of similar combs were found, representing
at least three additional combs, with teeth rather
finer than those in the illustrations.</p>


<p class="p3">III. <span class="smcap">Objects made of Horn.</span></p>

<p>Several portions of deer horns, consisting of tines and
thick portions of the body of the horn, together with a few
of the roe-deer, presenting sometimes marks of a saw and
sometimes those of a sharp-cutting tool, were found in the
refuse-heap. The few worked objects I have to record were
all made from horns of the former animal. One large antler,
having portion of the skull attached to it, and the entire
lateral half of the skull of a roe-deer with the horn still
adherent, show that the horns were not shed ones, but those
of animals actually caught and killed. The manufactured
implements consist of a few pointed objects, and one or two
handles, apparently for knives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>Fig. 220 represents a highly polished dagger-like implement,
measuring 7<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches long. Another, of about the same

A small pointed object is figured among the bone pins (see

<p>Wooden objects are extremely rare. One or two fragments
of what appeared to have been a bowl, portion of the
blade of an oar, a bit of board partially burnt and penetrated
by four round holes, together with three pins almost identical
with those found at Lochlee (see Figs. 112, 114, and
115). The bowl was ornamented by two or three incised
parallel lines near the rim. Another small fragment, which
might have been of the same vessel, had a clasp of thin brass
over it, as if it had been mended.</p>

<p class="p3b">(<em>c.</em>) <em>Articles made of Gold.</em></p>

<p><em>Finger-Rings.</em>&mdash;On the 14th December
one of the workmen while clearing out
the refuse-heap turned up a curious spectacle-like ornament,
made by twisting the ends of a thick and somewhat
square-shaped gold wire into the form of a double spiral
ring (Fig. 244). Upon close inspection it became evident
that originally this article was a handsome spiral finger-ring,
containing 5<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> twists, but that, from some means or
other, two of the twists had been forced apart from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
others. The direction of certain scratches, and a slight
mark as if a blow had been struck (probably the spade of
the finder), seem to me to confirm this explanation. It lay
buried half-way down in the midden, close to the base of
the large parapet in front of the entrance to the area of the
log-pavement. It weighs 300 grains, and its internal diameter
measures a shade over <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> of an inch. On the 16th
April, while clearing away the soil on the west side of the
crannog, a few feet to the inner side of the inner circle of
piles, another spiral ring was found (Fig. 245). It is made
of round gold wire, not quite so massive as the former, and
contains rather more than six twists. Both ends taper
slightly, and, for nearly a whole twist, are ornamented by a
series of circular grooves which gives them some resemblance
to the tail end of a serpent. The colour of the gold of this
ring is a brighter yellow than that of the former. Its internal
diameter is exactly <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> of an inch, and its weight is 245 grains.
Both rings were quite clean, and free from all tarnish when

<p><em>Coin.</em>&mdash;Mr. Robert Dunlop, iron-moulder, a native of
Kilmarnock, but now residing at Airdrie, happened to visit
his friends at the beginning of the year, and hearing of the
discoveries at the Buston crannog, took the opportunity of
visiting it. It was not, however, idle curiosity that prompted
him, but a true spirit of inquiry, which often ere now led
him to wander abroad as a humble student of nature, and
on one occasion even as far as the famous Kent's Cavern.
Being a Science teacher in Chemistry he was desirous of
securing specimens of the different forms of vivianite, and so
picked up from amidst a mass of broken bones and ashes
that had just been wheeled from the midden, a lump of a
bluish pasty substance, thinking it to be the amorphous form
of this mineral. He carried this lump home with him for
the purpose of analysing it, but, owing to other duties, was
unable to do so till some three months afterwards. Having
then taken a portion of the bluish mass, he mixed it with
water in a test-tube, and on proceeding to dissolve it, noticed
a yellow speck in this blue material. Curious to know what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
this could be he emptied the tube of its contents, and found
what seemed to be a small gold coin doubled up. The
slightest effort to restore the coin to its proper shape detached
the portions, and almost at the same moment each portion
separated into two thin plates. Mr. Dunlop then observed
that between the two plates there was a layer of a dark
brittle substance which he most judiciously collected into a
small glass tube for further analysis. Having then carefully
cleaned the four little plates with a weak solution of nitric
acid, he had the satisfaction, on putting them together, of
restoring the shell of an antique coin, which, as will be seen
from Fig. 246, retains its impressions and characters on both
sides wonderfully distinct. This valuable contribution to
the collection I received at once from its discoverer, as well
as the above narrative of its discovery.</p>

<p>Mr. Cochran-Patrick, M.P., to whom I immediately forwarded
the different portions of this coin carefully arranged
under a glass slide, as well as the glass tube containing
remains of its core, submitted them to the consideration of
J. Evans, Esq., F.R.S., F.S.A., so well known for his special
knowledge of ancient British coins.</p>

<p>The following interesting remarks by Mr. Evans on the
subject have been sent to me by Mr. Cochran-Patrick:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The two plates of gold seem originally to have formed
the shell of an early forgery of a coin, the oxidised core of
which forms the contents of the small tube. I thought at
first that the substance might be resinous, but I think it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
some salt of copper.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Some chemist could readily try this.
The coin itself belongs to a class of trientes which have
been found almost exclusively in England, and are probably
of Saxon origin. Enclosed is an impression of one found
near Dover. See Smith's <cite>Coll. Ant.</cite>, vol. i. pl. xxii. 9. Others
were in the Bagshot Heath or Crondale find. See <cite>Num.
Chron.</cite>, N. S., vol. x. 164, pl. xiii. 24 to 26; <cite>Num. Chron.</cite>,
vol. vi. They probably belong to the sixth or seventh century.
The find is of value as helping to assign a date to the
crannog." (Figs. 246 and 247.)</p>


<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">VI. Miscellaneous Objects.</span></p>

<p>1. <em>Armlets.</em>&mdash;Fragments of three armlets made of cannel
coal, very similar to those found at Lochlee and Lochspouts.</p>

<p>2. <em>Jet Ornament.</em>&mdash;A small link-shaped ornament of jet,
with two small holes for attachment in one side (Fig. 248).
This object was found on the surface of a mound of débris
long after it was wheeled out, and hence no dependence can
be put on its antiquity.</p>

<p>A round object, of the size of a small marble, made of
vitreous paste, variegated with blue and white, but without
any aperture.</p>

<p>Another small flattened object, about the size of a shilling,
made of a white compact vitreous substance. It is very
smooth, rounded on one side, but flattened on the other.
Looks like a drop of a semi-liquid that had fallen on a
smooth floor. In the York Museum, case C, amongst some
other Roman antiquities I observed several similar articles,
which are referred to in the Handbook as "roundlets of
coloured glass, probably to set in brooches, from the railway
excavations, 1874-75."</p>

<p>Fig. 250 represents a fragment of a small dish with its

<p>8. <em>Crucibles.</em>&mdash;A small conical crucible, made of hardened
clay arranged in two thin layers, the external of which looks
coarser than the other. It has a triangularly-shaped mouth,
and at one of its apices there is a slight indentation for facilitating
the pouring out of the smelted material. Its depth
is 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inch, and circumference of mouth 7 inches. It is
cracked all over with heat, and a little dark slag forming a
horizontal rim on its inner surface still remains to attest
its purpose. This relic was found on the west side of the
crannog, not far from the site of the second spiral ring, but
outside the inner circle of piles (Fig. 254).</p>

<p>A second crucible, neatly formed and quite whole, was
found in the débris wheeled out from the lowest stratum of
the refuse-heap. It is of the usual conical form, with a
three-cornered mouth about 3 inches in circumference, and
measures 1 inch in depth. Particles of a yellowish metal,
like brass or bronze, are seen mixed with a kind of slag, near
one of the corners. The outside has a glazed appearance, as
if it had been subjected to great heat, and to the apex of the
cone there is a small bit of cinder still adherent.</p>

<p>Portion of a third crucible, very similar to the last
described, was also found at the crannog by a visitor,
and publicly exhibited at a bazaar in Kilmarnock.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> This
crucible is interesting as furnishing undoubted evidence
that it had been used for melting gold, there being several
globules of this metal adhering to its sides, both inside and
outside.</p>


<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">Report of Osseous Remains found at Buston.</span></p>

<p class="p3b">(<span class="smcap">By Professor Cleland, M.D., F.R.S.</span>)</p>

<p>The osteological specimens obtained from what appears
to have been the kitchen-midden of the lake-dwelling at
Buston consist in greater part of bones of the ox; while next
in frequency are bones of the sheep and the pig. A calcaneum
and astragali of the red-deer have been found, as also
portions of large red-deer horns, and two portions of roe-deer
skull with horns attached. In addition a radius and metacarpal
of a goose were found.</p>

<p>The bones of the pig were both full-grown and young;
the full-grown, with the teeth worn, being apparently most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
abundant. They have belonged to an animal of small size,
similar probably to that whose remains are found in other
Ayrshire deposits.</p>

<p>The remains of the ox and the sheep I account more
interesting on account of variety among them.</p>

<p><em>Ox.</em>&mdash;Examining six portions of ox skull, I find one with
the horn-core represented by a mere nodule; two specimens
each with a portion of horn-core 2·8 inches in greatest diameter,
one with a horn-core 2·2 inches diameter at base, and
two others with horn-cores 1·8 inches in greatest diameter at
base, and one with a horn-core 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inch diameter. All the
horn-cores are fragmentary; but I judge that none of the
last three could have exceeded 5 inches in length, while the
first two must have been much longer. Only one of these
specimens, that with the smallest horn, has the suture above
the occipital bone open. The others must have been adult;
and we may judge that we have not to deal with mere aboriginal
<em>Bos longifrons</em>, but with varieties of ox. The variation
seems not to have been confined to the horns. Among a
number of first phalanges the majority were slender and small,
but there was considerable variety; and one specimen, contrasting
strongly with the others by its stoutness, might have
been from a small modern specimen. All the hoof-bones
which I collected, about half a dozen, were very small.
Three metacarpals were picked up, all measuring about 7
inches long and 1 inch in breadth at the narrowest part of
the shaft; and these are all adult specimens. Two adult
metatarsals measure, the one 8 inches in length and the other
only 7·3, while in breadth they both measure only ·9 of an
inch. A complete adult radius measures only 9 inches in
length. A lower end of a humerus is only 2·5 inches broad.
Among six calcanea the largest measured 5·5 inches, and the
shortest 4·3. In one specimen the orbit is 2·4 inches diameter,
and in another 2·8 inches, which is decidedly large.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
On the whole, the evidence is to the effect that while the
prevalent variety had small horns, and was generally diminutive
and slender-limbed, there was mixed with it a variety
with larger horns and stouter limbs, whether of greater
height or not I cannot say.</p>

<p><em>Sheep.</em>&mdash;Only one portion of horn-core was found with
portion of the skull. The portion of horn-core is between
3 and 4 inches long, and at the base its largest diameter
is 1·5 inch, its smallest 1 inch. At its inner margin starts
at an angle of about 20° from the vertical plane; while I
should say that in modern sheep that angle is always 45°
at least. I apprehend that this is probably the so-called
goat-horned sheep, scarcely now to be got in Shetland.</p>

<p>The following measurements of limb bones may be interesting,
as indicating considerable variety in size as well
as deviation from modern proportions, as indicated by comparison
with the bones of the same sheep skeleton which
I have used for comparison in previous communications.</p>

<p>One adult metatarsal measures 5·7 inches long and ·4
broad, and another 5·2 long and ·4 broad at the narrowest
part of the shaft. In the modern specimen this bone is
4·8 long and ·5 broad.</p>

<p>Three specimens of adult radius have been gathered,
measuring in length respectively 6·6, 6·, and 5·9; while in
the modern specimen the corresponding bone is only 5·2.</p>

<p>Two complete humeri are among the specimens gathered.
The largest, not quite adult, is 5·7 inches in greatest length;
while the other, quite adult, is only 5 inches long, and in
the modern specimen the humerus is 5·2 long. Four additional
specimens of the lower end of the humerus have been
obtained; and one of them is decidedly larger than the
largest complete specimen, and another decidedly smaller
than the smallest complete bone.</p>

<p>The sheep was therefore long and slender legged, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
those found on other Ayrshire deposits. But it is difficult
to determine whether the differences in size depend on sex,
or some other cause, such as cultivation.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="p4b">GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE CLASSIFICATION, GEOGRAPHICAL
DISTRIBUTION, STRUCTURE, AND AGE OF ANCIENT
SCOTTISH LAKE-DWELLINGS.</p></blockquote>


<p>In the foregoing chapters I have recorded nearly all the facts
hitherto derived from the explorations of Scottish Lake-Dwellings,
together with a few meagre notices of their
former existence supplied by historical research. Notwithstanding
the variety and number of objects found in these
remains, and the copiousness of details with which the
investigations are described, it may still be doubted whether
the time has arrived for applying to them the rigid principles
of induction, with the view of materially enlarging our knowledge
of the early inhabitants of this country. However
much variety or novelty may add to the interest attached
to antiquarian discoveries, it must never be forgotten that
their scientific value is to be determined by the extent to
which they can be made to enrich our knowledge of the
past phases of human civilisation. While, therefore, fully
conscious, on the one hand, of the danger of drawing a series
of inferences from too limited an experience, on the other, I
feel that to ignore altogether such oft-recurring questions as&mdash;When
did these lake-dwellings flourish? For what purpose
were they constructed? And what grade of civilisation
characterised their occupiers?&mdash;would be tantalising, if not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
uncourteous, to general readers who have so far perused the
mass of dry details here presented to them. In attempting,
therefore, to deal with the scientific aspect of these discoveries,
I do not for a moment profess such a minute
acquaintance with the science of archæology as to entitle me
even to attempt a full exposition of the inferences that may
be derived from their careful study and comparison with
other antiquarian remains; nor, indeed, do I believe that it
is within the province of any one man to give a final decision,
as it were <em>ex cathedra</em>, on a group or groups of remains
that include such comprehensive materials as the products
of the art, industry, culture, and social economy of a people
existing during an undefined period of time, and lying, in
a large measure, outside the pale of our historical records.
My purpose therefore is, while endeavouring to gratify the
laudable curiosity of general readers, to present archæologists
with a rough skeleton, which they are invited, piecemeal
fashion, to mould into a shapely figure by their combined
and varied experience.</p>

<p>To accomplish this object there are certain historical and
other collateral phenomena which, I think, help to circumscribe
the general sphere of the problems at issue, and
which, therefore, fall to be discussed alongside of the inductions
derived from the actual materials now before us. In
consequence of the diversity of the phenomena thus appealed
to, I have grouped their details under the following sections,
by means of which I hope to bring the general effect of their
chronological bearing into greater prominence:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Classification and geographical distribution of ancient
Scottish lake-dwellings.</p>

<p>2. Historical and traditional phenomena associated with
their area of distribution.</p>

<p>3. Mechanical skill displayed in the structure of the
wooden islands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>4. Topographical changes in the lake-dwelling area
during or subsequent to the period of their development.</p>

<p>5. Chronological, social, and other indications derived
from the relics.</p>


<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">Section I.</span></p>

<p class="p3b"><em>Classification and Geographical Distribution of Ancient
Scottish Lake-Dwellings.</em></p>

<p>The notices of artificial islands in Chapter II. are confined
to such as were found to be constructed on timber or
surrounded by stockades. There are, however, many others
still extant in several of our Scottish lakes, which appear to
be entirely composed of stones and earth irregularly heaped
together. In the absence of any historical knowledge as to
their age there is no <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">prima facie</i> reason why some at least
should not be contemporary with the former, as it cannot
be assumed that the crannog-builders made wood a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sine qua
non</i> in the structure of islands. There were, no doubt,
certain stagnant marshes and small lochs in which a wooden
foundation was essential for the formation of an island,
owing to the softness and yielding nature of the mud; but,
on the other hand, there were others with compact, rocky,
or gravelly beds, in which any solid materials, as stones,
earth, turf, etc., would be equally suitable. The outlets of
the larger lakes, more especially of such as were formed in
glacial and rock-cut basins, were more adapted for the latter,
and as far as my observations have enabled me to form an
opinion, these are the very situations in which the stone
islands are now found to prevail. Some of them are mere
shapeless cairns, without any indications of having been
formerly inhabited, while on others are to be found some
remains of stone buildings. As to wooden huts or houses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
had such structures been erected over them, it is not likely
that they could, for any length of time, have resisted the
decaying tendencies of a Scottish climate, so that all traces
of them would have disappeared long ago.</p>

<p>The social or military exigencies that led people to construct
artificial islands would also lead them to take advantage
of such natural ones as would be found most suitable,
and we may reasonably infer that it is in the absence of the
latter that the former would be resorted to. We have therefore
no <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">prima facie</i> grounds for dis-associating chronologically
the artificially-formed islands of wood or stone, either
from each other or from such natural islands as may furnish
evidence of early occupancy. The great and primary object
of the island-builder was the protection afforded by the surrounding
lake or morass, the securing of which has continued
to be a ruling principle in the erection of defensive works
down to the Middle Ages, long after the wooden islands
ceased to be constructed. The transition from an island
fort to the massive mediæval castle, with its moat and drawbridge,
is but another step in the progressive march of
civilisation.</p>

<p>When the greater advantages of stone buildings became
generally recognised, the old wooden refuges, so liable to
decay, so easily destroyed by fire, and so unsuitable for supporting
heavy buildings of masonry, would be gradually
superseded. It would then be found easier and better to
conduct the water to the stronghold than to construct the
stronghold in a natural basin of water, however convenient
its locality might be. To the transitional period preceding
this great change, which culminated in the almost impregnable
moated and mediæval castle, may be assigned many
of the remains of stone forts, castles, etc., still abundantly
found in bogs, drained marshes, and natural or, maybe, artificially
built islands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>While it is therefore possible to assign the wooden islands
to a fairly well-defined period, which, speaking generally,
precedes that when stone and lime were used for building
purposes in this country, the claims of all other island homes
to great antiquity must be judged of by their special peculiarities.</p>

<p>The annexed tabular statement comprises not only all
the known artificial islands, whether constructed of wood or
other materials, but also some natural ones known to have
been artificially strengthened or fortified, as well as a few
examples of other structural remains, such as camps, castles,
etc., now or formerly located in bogs or lakes. The first
column of numbers in this table contains only the crannogs
proper, <em>i.e.</em> islands constructed on wood and surrounded by
piles; while the second includes all the remaining classes.
The characteristic or differential features of all these examples,
when not referred to in the text, will be found in
the marginal notes or references, so that a mere glance gives
a general idea of their number, character, and geographical
distribution.</p>

<p>It is manifest, however, that a table of this kind can
have no permanent value, beyond giving a full and accurate
statement of discoveries up to date, as further researches
may not only change its numerical data, but give a totally
different aspect to inferences based on the existence or
absence of these remains in certain districts. Thus it is
only within the last few years that Ayrshire could be included
in the lake-dwelling area, so that, previously, the conflicting
statement made by Chalmers,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> that Galloway was colonised
by the Irish about the eighth century, derived some countenance
from the archæological discoveries in Loch Dowalton,
and other lakes in the neighbourhood, when taken in conjunction
with the prevalence of analogous remains in Ireland.
Though we cannot, therefore, argue definitely from the
present geographical distribution of Scottish Lake-Dwellings,
the indications are so clearly suggestive of their having been
peculiar to those districts formerly occupied by Celtic races
that the significance of this generalisation cannot be overlooked.
Thus, adopting Skene's division of the four kingdoms
into which Scotland was ultimately divided by the contending
nationalities of Picts, Scots, Angles, and Strathclyde Britons,
after the final withdrawal of the Romans, we see that of all
the crannogs proper, none have been found within the
territories of the Angles;<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> ten and six are respectively within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
the confines of the Picts and Scots; while no less than twenty-eight
are situated in the Scottish portion of the ancient
kingdom of Strathclyde. Nor is this generalisation much
affected by an extension of the list, so as to include those
stony islets so frequently met with in the Highland lakes.
On the other hand, that they have not been found in the
south-eastern parts of Scotland may suggest the theory that
these districts had been occupied by the Angles before Celtic
civilisation&mdash;or rather the warlike necessities of the times&mdash;gave
birth to the island dwellings. In that case we would
suppose that their development dates back to the unsettled
events which immediately followed the withdrawal of the
Roman soldiers, to whose protection the Romano-British
population in the south-west of Scotland had been so long
accustomed. But this leads me to notice some of the
historical phenomena associated with the localities thus
referred to.</p>

following winter is thus described by Tacitus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"To introduce a system of new and wise regulations was the
business of the following winter. A fierce and savage people,
running wild in the woods, would be ever addicted to a life of
warfare. To wean them from these habits, Agricola held forth
the baits of pleasure, encouraged the natives, as well by public
assistance, as by warm exhortations, to build temples, courts of
justice, and commodious dwelling-houses. He bestowed encomiums
on such as cheerfully obeyed; the slow and uncomplying
were branded with reproach; and thus a spirit of emulation
diffused itself, operating like a sense of duty. To establish
a plan of education, and give the sons of the leading chiefs a
tincture of letters, was part of his policy. By way of encouragement
he praised their talents, and already saw them, by the force
of their natural genius, rising superior to the attainments of the
Gauls. The consequence was, that they, who had always
disdained the Roman language, began to cultivate its beauties.
The Roman apparel was seen without prejudice, and the toga
became a fashionable part of dress. By degrees the charms of
vice gained admission to their hearts; baths, and porticos, and
elegant banquets grew into vogue; and the new manners, which,
in fact, served only to sweeten slavery, were by the unsuspecting
Britons called the arts of polished humanity."&mdash;(<cite>Vit. Agric.</cite> chap. 21.)</p></blockquote>

<p>During the following summer, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 80, Agricola pursued
his journey northwards and entered on a country hitherto
unknown to the Romans, and described by Tacitus as occupied
by <em>new nations</em>, which he laid waste as far as the Firth of
Tay. During the six following years this general was engaged
in bringing the wild Caledonians under subjection. In the
year 81 he erected a chain of forts between the Firths of
Forth and Clyde. Subsequently he visited Argyll and
Kintyre, as well as the eastern counties, and explored the
interior as far as the Grampian range of mountains. At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
same time, the fleet, sailing northwards along the east coast,
circumnavigated the island and returned by the straits of
Dover to its former station. These exploits roused the
warlike spirit of the Caledonians, and all the northern tribes
combined to resist the progress of the invaders, the result
of which was the famous battle of Mons Grampius (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 86),
in which 30,000 Caledonians were totally routed. Tacitus
in his description of the battle states that the Caledonians
were arranged in lines along the slopes of the rising ground,
having their charioteers and cavalry in front, and that their
weapons were arrows, long pointless swords, and small
targets; whereas the Romans used large shields and short
pointed swords, which gave them the advantage at close
quarters. As soon as the battle was known at Rome,
Agricola was recalled through the jealousy of the Emperor
Domitian, so that no advantage was taken of the campaign,
and the result was that the northern tribes beyond the Tay
retained their independence.</p>

<p>From the recall of Agricola till the accession of the
Emperor Hadrian, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 117, nothing is known of the condition
of this part of the island. Hadrian visited Britain in
the year 120, and appears to have put down a threatened
insurrection by giving up Agricola's line of forts, and limiting
the frontier of the province to a line right across the territory
of the Brigantes from the Solway Firth to the river Tyne.
Along this line he constructed an immense barrier consisting
of, first, on the north side, a ditch, then a stone wall, and
then an earthen rampart. Between the two latter were
roads for the transmission of troops, with stations, castles,
and watch-towers. But this barrier did not act for a long
time as a check to the independent section of the Brigantes,
who, early in the reign of Antoninus, crossed the wall and
overran portions of the Roman Province. But Lollius
Urbicus, who was sent to Britain, quickly subdued these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
hostile tribes (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 139), and again extended the Province
to its former limit, viz., the line between the Firths of Forth
and Clyde, where he constructed an earthen rampart&mdash;"Alio
muro cespiticio submotis barbaris ducto."</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 162 an attempt on the Province by the northern
tribes was quelled by Calphurnius Agricola.</p>

<p>Twenty years later they made another formidable
irruption into the Province, but were repelled by Marcellus
Ulpius.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 208 the Emperor Severus found it necessary to
come in person to repel these frequent and formidable attacks
of the northern barbarians, whom we now find under the
names of Mæatæ and Caledonii. The former occupied the
lower lands next the wall, and the latter the mountainous
regions beyond, but notwithstanding the difference in name,
they appear to have been virtually the same people.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The manners of the two nations are described as the same,
and they are viewed by the historians in these respects as if they
were but one people. They are said to have neither walls nor
cities, as the Romans regarded such, and to have neglected the
cultivation of the ground. They lived by pasturage, the chase,
and the natural fruits of the earth. The great characteristics
of the tribes believed to be indigenous were found to exist
among them. They fought in chariots, and to their arms of
the sword and shield, as described by Tacitus, they had now
added a short spear of peculiar construction, having a brazen
knob at the end of the shaft, which they shook to terrify their
enemies, and likewise a dagger. They are said to have had
community of women, and the whole of their progeny were
reared as the joint offspring of each small community. And the
third great characteristic, the custom of painting the body,
attracted particular notice. They are described as puncturing
their bodies, so as, by a process of tattooing, to produce the
representation of animals, and to have refrained from clothing,
in order that what they considered an ornament should not be
hidden."&mdash;(Skene, <cite>Celtic Scotland</cite>, vol. i. p. 83.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Severus opened up the country by cutting down woods,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
throwing bridges across the rivers, clearing the jungles, and
making roads in various directions, and in this manner,
after great loss of human life, but without fighting a single
battle, he penetrated as far north as the shores of the
Moray Firth. Returning through the heart of the Highlands
he concluded a peace with the Caledonians, from whom
he received hostages. He then rebuilt the wall between the
Clyde and the Forth and returned to York. Soon afterwards
the Mæatæ and Caledonii again revolted, and thus a
second time drew forth the ire of the aged Emperor, but, while
he was preparing a severe revenge, death overtook him.</p>

<p>Little is known of the subsequent relative positions of the
Romans and Caledonians till <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 306, when Constantius
Chlorus is said to have penetrated into the low country
beyond the wall, and defeated the Picts.</p>

<p>For upwards of fifty years there is again a complete silence
as to the conduct of the natives beyond the Roman boundary,
and it is not till <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 360 that they reappear on the
historic field. Then the comparative security and prosperity
enjoyed by the provincial Britons during the last 150
years was broken, and the inroads of the barbarians into the
province became so formidable that they appeared to be
deliberate attempts to drive the Romans entirely out of
Britain. The Picts were now joined by a new nation which
emerged from Ireland, and became known to the Romans
under the name Scoti. The effect of this combination of
hostile tribes is thus described by Mr. Skene:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We learn from the account given by the historian of their
eventual recovery, that the districts ravaged by the Picts were
those extending from the territories of the independent tribes
to the wall of Hadrian between the Tyne and the Solway, and
that the districts occupied by the Scots were in a different direction.
They lay on the western frontier, and consisted of part of
the mountain region of Wales on the coast opposite to Ierne, or
the island of Ireland, from whence they came.... During<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
four years the invading tribes retained possession of the districts
they had occupied, and were with difficulty prevented from
overrunning the province; but in the fourth year a more formidable
irruption took place. To the two nations of the Picts and
the Scots were now added two other invading tribes&mdash;the Saxons,
who had already made themselves known and dreaded by their
piratical incursions on the coast; and the Attacotti, who, we
shall afterwards find, were a part of the inhabitants of the territory
on the north of Hadrian's wall, from which the Romans had
been driven out on its seizure by the independent tribes. They
now joined the Picts in invading the province from the north,
while the attack of the Saxons must have been directed against
the south-eastern shore; and thus assailing the provinces on
three sides&mdash;the Saxons making incursions on the coast between
the Wash and Portsmouth, afterwards termed the Saxon Shore,
where they appear to have slain Nectarides, the Count of the
maritime tract, the Picts and Attacotts on the north placing
Fallofandus, the Dux Britanniarum, whose duty it was to guard
the northern frontier, in extreme peril, and the Scots penetrating
through the mountains of Wales&mdash;the invading tribes penetrated
so far into the interior, and the extent and character of
their ravages so greatly threatened the very existence of the
Roman government, that the Emperor (Julian) became roused to
the imminence of the danger, and, after various officers had been
sent without effect, the most eminent commander of the day,
Theodosius the elder, was despatched to the assistance of the
Britons. He found the province in the possession of the Picts,
the Scots, and the Attacotts, who were ravaging it and plundering
the inhabitants in different directions. The Picts, we are
told, were then divided into two nations, the 'Dicalidonæ' and
the 'Vecturiones,' a division evidently corresponding to the twofold
division of the hostile tribes in the time of Severus, the
'Caledonii' and the 'Mæatæ.' The similarity of name and
situation sufficiently identifies the first-mentioned people in each
of the twofold divisions. The Mæatæ had been obliged to cede
a part of their territory to the Romans, so that part of the nation
had passed under their rule, and a part only remaining independent
probably gave rise to the new name of 'Vecturiones.' The
'Attacotti,' we are told, were a warlike nation of the Britons,
and the epithet applied to the 'Scoti' of ranging here and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
shows that their attacks must have been made on different parts
of the coast."&mdash;(Skene, <cite>Celtic Scotland</cite>, vol. i. pp. 98-100.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Theodosius, with a powerful army, soon drove back the
invaders, and restored the province to its former integrity;
but his success was without any permanent result. During
the next forty years, till the final withdrawal of the Roman
troops in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 410, the provincial Britons, especially those
inhabiting the district between the two walls, became a prey
to the surrounding hostile nations as often as the increasing
demands on the military resources of the Empire at home
caused a temporary retirement of its troops. Thus, during
the short period here referred to, the portion of the Province
was overrun and desolated no less than three different
times, and as often restored by the Roman legions. At
length, however, a time came when these were destined
never to return, and the semi-Romanised Britons were
allowed to struggle with the northern barbarians as best
they could. What took place in North Britain after this
great event, or how the contending nationalities settled
the country among them, can only be gleaned by the uncertain
voice of tradition; nor was the veil of darkness which
thus fell on the country removed till a new source of historical
records sprung up by means of the civilising influence
of the early Christian Church and her learned emissaries.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When the page of history once more opens to its annals,
we find that the barbaric nations whom we left harassing the
Roman province till the Romans abandoned the island, had now
effected fixed settlements within the island, and formed permanent
kingdoms within its limits. South of the Firths of Forth
and Clyde we find her containing a Saxon organisation, and
tribes of Teutonic descent, hitherto known by the general name
of Saxons, in full possession of her most valuable and fertile districts,
and the Romans of the old British provincials confined to
the mountains of Wales and Cumbria, the western districts
extending from the Solway to the Clyde, and the peninsula of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
Cornwall. North of the Firths we find the barbarian tribes of
the Picts and Scots, which had so often harassed the Roman province
from the north and west, formed into settled kingdoms
with definite limits; while Hibernia or Ireland now appears
under the additional designation of Scotia."&mdash;(Skene, <cite>Celtic Scotland</cite>,
vol. i. p. 115.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The settlements of these four nationalities were as
follows:&mdash;The Angles occupied the south-eastern district,
and ultimately formed the kingdom of Northumbria, which
extended from the Firth of Forth to the river Humber.
The provincial Britons were divided into several petty
states, which originally belonged to two varieties of the
British race. Those in the northern districts, corresponding
to the Damnonii of Ptolemy, and occupying the modern
shires of Lanark, Renfrew, and Ayr, are said to have belonged
to the Cornish variety; while the Cymric branch extended
as far north as Dumfriesshire. The battle of Ardderyd<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
(Arthuret, west side of the Esk near Carlisle), in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 573,
which ended in the defeat of the Angles, consolidated these
petty states into the kingdom of Cumbria or Strathclyde
under Rhydderch with the fortress of Alclyde (Dumbarton)
as its capital. (573-601 Rodercus filius Totail regnavit in
Petra Cloithe.&mdash;Adamnan.)</p>

<p>The counties of Wigtown and Kirkcudbright were occupied
in the second century by the Novantæ, having two
towns called Rerigonium and Leucopibia. The ancient
Celtic name of the district was in Irish Gallgaidhel (<em>i.e.
foreign Gael</em>), and in Welsh Galwydel, and hence in Latin
<em>Gallovidia, Galloweithia</em>, now Galloway. Its inhabitants
were called by Bede "Niduari Picti," and they were known
as the Galloway Picts as late as the twelfth century. The
most puzzling statement about this district is that of
Chalmers (<cite>Caledonia</cite>, i. p. 358), who states that Galloway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
was colonised in the eighth century by the Cruithne from
Ireland. Cruithne is the Irish equivalent to Picti, and a
people known by this name occupied the larger portion of
Ulster. According to Skene, however, Chalmers's statement
is not supported by any evidence.</p>

<p>The Scots forming the kingdom of Dalriada occupied
that portion of the west of Scotland corresponding to
Argyllshire, and had the fortress of Dunadd as their chief
stronghold.</p>

<p>The rest of Scotland, with the exception of a portion of
the low country near the Roman wall, which became a
debatable territory, and often the theatre of wars amongst
the four surrounding nations, constituted the so-called Pictish
kingdom.</p>

<p>Christianity was introduced into Scotland from two
different sources. The Southern Picts were converted to the
Faith by St. Ninian, who derived his teaching direct from
Rome, and founded a church at Candida Casa (Whithorn)
as early as <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 397; while St. Columba, the Apostle of the
Northern Picts, came from Ireland in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 563, and
developed the Columban branch of the Church, having its
headquarters at Iona. The more important of the subsequent
events of these four kingdoms are here briefly
arranged in chronological order:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">Section III.</span></p>

<p class="p3b"><em>Structure of the Wooden Islands.</em></p>

<p>In my Introductory Chapter I have remarked that none
of the Irish writers appear to have paid much attention to
the mechanical principles on which the wooden islands were
constructed. A similar remark is equally applicable to the
writers on Scottish crannogs. Dr. Stuart had got hold of the
general idea that the mortised transverses were used for the
purpose of steadying the uprights, and that the outer structures
were adapted to resist the action of the surrounding
water. The following are his words: "Of the first class,
or the crannog proper, the ordinary construction was by
logs of wood in the bed of the lake supporting a structure
of earth or stones, or of a mixture of both, the mass being
surrounded by piles of young oak-trees in the bed of the
lake, the inner row of which kept the island in shape, and
the external rows acted as defences and breakwaters."<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
But these views convey only a partial notion of a more comprehensive
system, the meaning of which I was only able to
perceive after my experience at Buston. Notwithstanding
that I made the structural arrangements of the Lochlee crannog
a particular point of study, I failed to adduce a satisfactory
theory for the details recorded; and, beyond showing
that the two inner circles of uprights, with their radial and
circumferential transverses which immediately surrounded
the log pavement, formed a kind of breastwork or wall some
3 feet high, I made no advance on Dr. Stuart's theory. I
could offer no explanation of the other large mortised beams
found external to this circle, nor of the network of oak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
beams&mdash;some with mortised holes, and others with tenons
to fit into continuous beams&mdash;which became manifest on
making the deep shaft, and appeared to permeate the whole
structure of the island. The advantage of carefully recording
every fact, however trivial or obscure, has never been
better illustrated than in this very article (that on the Lochlee
crannog), as, with the more recent light thrown upon the subject,
there can be no doubt that these structures, as well as
the mortised beams (one of which contained three holes)
lying on the western margin of the crannog, were some of the
radial beams of an encircling girdle, still <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in situ</i>, which surrounded
and knit together the island in a precisely similar
manner to that at Buston, as described at page 197. At
Buston also, the inner circle, as evidenced by its mural
remains, formed part of the enclosure surrounding the log
pavement, and thus corresponded with, and served the same
purpose as, the breastwork at Lochlee. Again, on the south
side of both crannogs, the circles were more numerous, and
occupied a larger area than on the north side, but with this
difference,&mdash;that at Lochlee the midden covered the greater
portion of this space, which at Buston was converted into an
open and partially paved promenade.</p>

<p>In the incidental notices of these islands, given in Chapter
II., the narrators sometimes describe them as having been
built on a framework of oak, as at Lochrutton, Loch Kinder,
etc. At other times the only evidence of a crannog consists
in fishing up oak beams from the bottom of a lake, or their
discovery under its surface inextricably mortised into others,
as at Loch Lomond, Lochmaben, Loch Lochy, etc., while in
drained lakes and morasses the chief indications are the tops
of upright piles surrounding a flat mound. But all these
accounts, as well as the more recent notices of crannogs, are
characterised by two prominent structural features, viz., (1)
upright piles in the form of one or more circles; and (2) the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
remains of flat beams containing large square-cut holes at
their extremities.</p>

<p>The quotations from the Irish writers, given at pp. 6-11,
will also show that the same structural features characterise
many of the descriptive notices of the crannogs of Ireland.
Dr. Stuart also draws particular attention to similar beams
at Dowalton, some of which were of "great size and length
(one of them 12 feet long), with three mortised holes in the
length, 7 inches square." These indications, as well as a careful
study of the structural details recorded in my reports of
the explorations made at Lochlee, Lochspouts, and Buston,
have led me to believe that all the wooden islands were constructed
after one uniform plan, and that this plan was
actually the outcome of the highest mechanical principles
that the circumstances could admit of. Indeed, I am prepared
to maintain that were the same problem submitted to
modern engineers, they could make no improvement either
on the principle or mechanism displayed in these singular
structures. Let me therefore, in the first place, note the conditions
that called forth such high mechanical and engineering
qualities. For defence and protection, which, I presume,
no one will doubt were the primary objects of these islands,
a small mossy lake, with its margin overgrown with reeds
and grasses, and situated in a secluded locality amidst the
thick meshes of the primeval forests of those days, would
present the most desirable topographical conditions. Having
fixed on such a locality, the next consideration would be the
selection of materials for building the island. In a lake
containing the soft and yielding sediment due to decomposed
vegetable matter, it is manifest that any heavy substances,
as stones and earth, would be totally inadmissible owing to
their weight, so that solid logs of wood, provided there was an
abundant supply at hand, would be the best and cheapest
material that could be used. To construct in 10 or 12 feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
of water, virtually floating over an unfathomable quagmire,
a solid compact island, with a circular area of 100 feet or
more, and capable of enduring for centuries as a retreat for
men and animals, would, I daresay, be the means of eliciting
from many an engineer of the present day a more frequent
manifestation of the proverbial symptom of a puzzled Scotchman
than from these early brothers of the craft&mdash;the crannog-builders.</p>

<p>This is how they worked:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1.) Immediately over the chosen site a circular raft of
trunks of trees, laid above branches and brushwood,
was formed, and above it additional layers
of logs, together with stones, gravel, etc., were
heaped up till the whole mass grounded.</p>

<p>(2.) As this process went on, upright piles, made of oak,
and of the required length, were inserted into
prepared holes in the structure, and probably also
a few were inserted into the bed of the lake.</p>

<p>(3.) The rough logs forming the horizontal layers were
made of various kinds of wood, generally birch, it
being the most abundant. These were occasionally
pinned together by thick oak pegs, and here
and there at various levels oak-beams mortised
into one another stretched across the substance of
the island, and joined the surrounding piles.</p>

<p>(4.) When a sufficient height above the water-line was
attained, a prepared pavement of oak-beams was
constructed, and mortised beams were laid over
the tops of the encircling piles which bound them
firmly together as already described. The margin
of the island was also slantingly shaped by an
intricate arrangement of beams and stones, constituting
in some cases, according to Dr. Stuart,
a well-formed breakwater.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>(5.) When the skeleton of the island was thus finished,
probably turf would be laid over its margin where
the pointed piles protruded, and a superficial
barrier of hurdles, or some such fence, erected
close to the edge of the water.</p>

<p>(6.) Frequently a wooden gangway, probably submerged,
stretched to the shore, by means of which secret
access to the crannog could be obtained without
the use of a canoe. (For the mode of structure
of gangway, see page 101.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Bearing in mind that all these structures were solidly
put together without nails or bolts, and that the gangways,
which have remained permanently fixed to the present time,
had neither joint nor mortise, we may fearlessly challenge
modern science to produce better results under these, or
indeed any, circumstances.</p>

<p>That future discoveries may show slight deviations from
the exactness of these details I am quite prepared to believe,
as the mechanical knowledge of the age was too thorough
not to be readily adapted to varied circumstances. What
I do however maintain is, that the general principles of
structure here laid down, being the outcome of a sound
knowledge of mechanics, varied during the whole period of
their practical application as little as the essential laws of
architecture do in the structure of different styles of our
modern houses.</p>

<p>Not only do these wooden islands evince much mechanical
and technical skill on the part of their founders, but, what
is still more singular, their area of distribution appears to
have been co-extensive with the districts formerly occupied
by Celtic races. Hence we have here another proof of the
extraordinary vigour, intense individuality, and plastic character
of early Celtic civilisation, in thus developing, from its
own inherent resources, a unique form of stronghold, simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
in structure, but yet admirably adapted to the unsettled conditions
of life and military requirements of the period.</p>

<p class="p3b"><em>Topographical Changes in the Lake-Dwelling Area during
or subsequent to the Period of their Development.</em></p>

<p><em>Supposed Change in Climate, and its effects.</em>&mdash;The arguments
in support of the theory that a material deterioration
has taken place in the climate of Britain since the Roman
period are generally based on the following considerations:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p3b">(1.) <em>Historical Statements.</em></p>

<p>Roman historians agree in representing the climate as humid,
but so mild that the natives went about in a semi-nude condition,
favourable to luxuriant vegetation, and not so cold as that of
Gaul. Thus Cæsar expressly states that all kinds of trees grew
in Britain, except the <em>fir</em> and the <em>beech</em>, and that the climate was
more temperate than in Gaul. Tacitus describes the climate
as always damp with rains, and overcast with clouds, without,
however, intense cold being even felt. In the speech attributed
to Galgacus, previous to the battle of Mons Grampius, he
says that their "bodies and limbs were worn out by cutting
down woods, draining bogs, stripes, and outrages;" and the
same historian, in describing the result of a previous engagement
in Fifeshire, in which the Caledonians were beaten, states that
"had not the woods and marshes favoured their retreat, this
victory in all probability would have put an end to the war."
Another writer (Dion Cassius) describes the Caledonians as dwelling
in tents, naked, and without shoes; enduring hunger, cold,
and all manner of hardships with wonderful patience; and
capable of remaining in bogs for many days immersed up to the
neck, and without food. In the woods they lived on the bark of
trees and roots, and had a certain sort of food always ready, of
which, if they took but the quantity of a bean, they would
neither be hungry nor dry for a long time after. Herodian also
describes them as going about partially naked to prevent the
beautiful figures painted on their bodies from being hidden.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
According to him, they used iron as other barbarians did gold,
both as an ornament and sign of wealth. They wore neither coat
of mail nor helmet to prevent being encumbered in their marches
through bogs and mosses, whence such a quantity of vapours
was exhaled that the air was always thick and cloudy.</p>

<p>(2.) <em>The numerous remains of forest trees found in bogs
and mosses in localities where, at the present time, no such trees
are found to grow.</em></p>

<p>As indicating the kind of evidence brought forward in support
of this argument, the following extracts will suffice:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Of old, in the parish of Croy, Inverness-shire, and before
the records of the kingdom, there were extensive forests of oak,
birch, fir, and hazel, which have been converted into moss, in
some places upwards of 20 feet deep. In a moss 400 feet above
the level of the sea, oaks of extraordinary size are dug up, some
of them measuring from 50 to 60 feet, and of proportional thickness;
and even at the height of 800 feet, where the parish joins
the Strathdearn hills, large blocks of fir are found, where now,
from cold and storm, the dwarf willow can scarcely raise its
downy and lowly head."&mdash;(<cite>New Stat. Account</cite>, vol. xiv. p. 449.)</p></blockquote>

<p>A writer in the <cite>Old Stat. Account</cite> (vol. xv. p. 484) referring
to moss in the parish of Kilbarchan, Renfrewshire, from
7 to 9 feet deep, says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The soil below is a deep white clay, where has formerly
been a forest. The oak is perfectly fresh; the other kinds
of timber are rotten. The stumps in general are standing in
their original position. The trees are all broken over at about
the height of 3 feet, and are lying from south-west to north-east.
So, wherever you see a stump, you are sure to find a tree to the
north-east. How an oak-tree could break over at that particular
place, I never could understand. But we may be allowed to
form a conjecture, that before the tree fell, the moss had advanced
along its stem and rotted it there."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Aiton, in an excellent introduction to his treatise on
Moss Earth, thus writes:<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Trees of enormous dimensions have grown spontaneously
in many parts of Britain, where it would baffle the ingenuity of
man to rear a tree to the tenth part of the size. The mosses in
all parts of the island abound with trees of much greater dimensions
than any now to be found growing in this country. The
late Mr. Browning found an oak-tree under a moss in his lands
of Benthall, in East Kilbride, of such size and preservation as to
floor a garret 20 feet long by 16 wide. The boards, more than
an inch in thickness, may still be seen at Benthall. Another oak-tree
may be seen there upwards of 60 feet in length. It has
evidently been broken at both ends, and the lower end not being
completely covered with moss, has rotted so much that the dimensions
of the tree cannot now be ascertained, but the upper end
is more than 4 feet in circumference.</p>

<p>"At Thriepwood, in Dalserf parish, and county of Lanark, the
trunk of an oak-tree 65 feet in length was a few years ago dug
from under moss. It was as straight as the mast of a ship, and
so equal in thickness at both ends, that it was not easy to say
which was the root. Both these trees had grown at 500 feet of
altitude above the level of the sea, and on ground on which it
would be difficult to rear an oak to the twentieth part of the
size.</p>

<p>"Many fir-trees 100 feet in length have been found under
moss. But, what is still more surprising, oak-trees 100 feet long
were found on draining Hartfield Moss in Yorkshire. They were
as black as ebony, and some of them sold one hundred and fifty
years ago as high as £15 for one tree. One oak-tree was dug
from under that moss, which measured 120 feet in length, 12
feet in diameter at the root, and 6 feet diameter at the top!
Twenty pounds sterling was then offered for that single tree.
One of the same dimensions, with its bark, would sell now at
£300, but no such tree at present exists in Europe....</p>

<p>"But the climate was then also more congenial to the growth
of fruits, grapes, etc., as we have seen, and also of grain, than it
is now. The records of the Religious Houses show that wheat
was paid as a tithe from lands on which human industry could not
now raise that species of grain. Wheat was paid annually as a
tithe to the Priory of Lesmahagow from lands in that parish, on
which that species of grain has not been sown for several centuries
past, and where it could not now be raised; where, under
the present economy, oats can scarcely be brought to perfection.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
The minister of Glenluce, in the Statistical Account of his parish,
mentions a farm that paid to the monastery of Glenluce twelve
bolls of wheat and the same quantity of barley as a tithe. But
such is the melancholy alteration that, about thirty years ago,
that very farm was set at £12 of yearly rent. Similar instances
might be pointed out in many parts of Scotland."</p></blockquote>

<p>The inferences derived from these and similar observations
made on the phenomena of peat bogs and their buried
forests in many other parts of Scotland, are somewhat conflicting.
There can be no doubt that the climatal conditions
that permitted oaks to grow on the higher slopes of the hills
in the north of Scotland, as well as trees of considerable
size in the Orkney and Shetland Islands, where scarcely a
stunted shrub is now to be seen growing in a wild state, were
more favourable to the growth of forest trees than those
which now prevail. On the other hand, the large pines
found in some of the Lowland mosses would seem to
indicate a colder climate. The probable explanation of this
is, that the pines and oaks belong to different periods of
time, that the former preceded the latter and flourished
when Scotland stood higher above the level of the sea, and,
being thus more extensive, was under a colder climate, somewhat
analogous to that which now prevails in Norway.
These conditions gradually gave place to a more genial
climate, which also induced a corresponding change in its
flora. This apparently more temperate climate appears to
have been succeeded by another change in the climatal
conditions, this time of a less genial character, and not so
favourable to the growth of the oaks, and to which they, in
their turn, gradually yielded in point of luxuriance, and
ultimately succumbed to the encroachment of the bogs and
peat-mosses.</p>

<p>To discuss at greater length the climatal changes which
may have occurred since the great oaks and pines of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
moss-covered forests flourished, would be a digression from
the main object of this work. In geological and astronomical
causes some scientists believe they have a sufficient
explanation of the strange, and sometimes severe, oscillations
that are known to have taken place in post-Tertiary
times, so that the disappearance of the ancient forests
from the country, and the subsequent increase of the peat
bogs, may be looked upon as the effect rather than the
cause of our altered climate. There can hardly be any
doubt, however, that during prehistoric times, and towards
the dawn of European history, North Britain was extensively
covered with forests which were characterised by a luxuriance
of growth which is not now attained in the same
latitudes. Hence the statements made by Roman historians
to the effect that the natives painted their bodies and
roamed about in a semi-nude condition must not necessarily
be stigmatised as fables. That the inhabitants themselves
greatly contributed to the clearance of the woods
and jungles, as they became practically acquainted with
the advantages of systematic tillage of the ground, is
also probable. But this change was not produced all at
once, as it is proved by such numerous place-names as
Woodlands, Woodend, Woodside, Linwood, Fulwood, Oakshaw-side,
Oakshaw-head, Walkingshaw, Lainshaw, etc.
etc., that the south-west of Scotland was well wooded
after the Celtic language had been superseded by the
Saxon dialects. Cosmo Innes thus alludes to the subject:
"At the earliest period illustrated by the Melrose
charters there is sufficient evidence that the southern division
of Scotland was not a well-wooded country. On the contrary,
the right of cutting wood was carefully reserved when
pasturage or arable land was granted; and when that right
was conceded for some particular purpose, such as for fuel
for a salt-work, or for building, the use was limited in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
express terms. The high grounds of Ayrshire may be an
exception, where there seems to have existed an extensive
forest; but elsewhere wood was a scarce and valuable commodity."<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Though the gradual extinction of our primeval forests,
the growth of peat bogs, and many other topographical
phenomena, are thus distinctly traceable in the long vista
which extends backwards to prehistoric, if not, indeed, to geological
times, there are no definite landmarks, beyond a certain
chronological sequence, by means of which these physical
changes can be more directly measured on the scale of time.</p>

<p>Amidst the abundant traces of struggling humanity, by
which the whole line of this hazy vista is characterised, we
see the remains of these lake-dwellings. The topographical
features and environments of Loch Buston, when the crannog-builders
commenced their structural operations, were totally
different from what they are now. Then a stagnant lake,
deeply encroached upon by a marginal zone of aquatic plants,
and surrounded by a forest of oaks<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> and other indigenous
trees, occupied the site of the present fertile basin; now the
whole country-side is laid out into regular and well-cultivated
fields, with encircling hedges, and scarcely a tree to mark
the once wooded locality, part of which is still significantly
known as the Shaws. For upwards of half a century the
present farmer has been raising splendid crops of grain, not
only from the whole area of the dried-up lake, but over the
very site of the crannog. And as for the size of the trees
which formerly grew here, I question if there is an oak now
growing in the whole of Ayrshire from which a dug-out
canoe, having dimensions as large as the one found at Loch
Buston, could be made. The scene strongly reminds me of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
a visit to Ephesus, when, after inspecting the ruins of its
once busy harbour, I penned the following words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This (the famous Panormus) consists of a stone-built quay,
overlooking what used to be the harbour, having behind it a
series of vaults and passages, which must have been used as
stores. Now, however, instead of gazing on the sea, studded
with ships from all nations, and a crowded harbour, as St. Paul
did when he landed at Ephesus, we had before us a rich green
field of wheat just coming into ear, dotted here and there with
some ugly-looking fig-trees. As for the sea, it was nowhere to be
seen, being distant some four or five miles. The alluvial deposits
of fifteen centuries have thus not only raised the general level of
the valley, and covered it with débris to the thickness of about
12 feet, but also very considerably enlarged its area, and converted
it now into an unhealthy and marshy wilderness."<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><em>Increase of Lake Silt.</em>&mdash;But is there nothing in the local
phenomena of these lake-dwellings to indicate, even approximately,
the period of their existence, or the changes
that have taken place since, by submergence, they have
disappeared from the gaze of mankind? Dame Nature
retains many agents in her service who faithfully keep tally
of many passing events, though not always by days or
years. The woody rings of a tree, water-worn channels,
strata in rocks, and accumulated mud, are some of the piles
of records which she freely places at our disposal&mdash;though
often only to baffle our limited and feeble efforts to decipher
them. Can we therefore elicit any reliable data from an
examination of the accumulated silt from which the remains
of the lake-dwellings are now and again disentombed? Let
us see. A few yards from the Buston crannog, where the
canoe was found, the upper stratum of the lake sediment,
for about the thickness of 2 feet, consisted of a brown
clayey substance, but, underneath this, the stuff had assumed
a more peaty character, being softer, darker in colour, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
not so heavy. The line of demarcation between these layers
was so well marked, that Mrs. Anstruther, in taking a sketch
of the canoe while still lying in its original bed, shows
this feature on the exposed wall of the trench (Fig. 191).
The lowest portion of the canoe was exactly 6 feet below
the surface, so that, since its final abandonment, 4 feet of
this dark substance gradually accumulated around it. Then
however, some sudden change appears to have taken place
in its composition, and under the altered circumstances another
two feet were added.</p>

<p>It is strange that this phenomenon is identical with
what has been observed and recorded at Lochlee. In
making a large trench, so as to expose the deeper structures
of the gangway, the following particulars were noted
(see page 100):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1.) The uppermost portion was a bed of fine clay rather
more than 2 feet thick.</p>

<p>(2.) Below this was a soft dark substance, formed of
decomposed vegetable matters.</p>

<p>(3.) At a depth of 7 feet the first horizontal beams of the
gangway were encountered.</p>

<p>(4.) At 10 feet deep the base of the gangway was supposed
to be reached.</p></blockquote>

<p>The canoe found at Lochlee, though in a different part of
the lake-bed, was also buried to a depth of from 5 to 6 feet.</p>

<p>Regarding the marked change in the upper portion of the
sedimentary deposits in both these lakes, perhaps no better
explanation can be offered than that already suggested at
page 151, viz., that it is due to the disappearance of the
primeval forests which formerly covered their drainage areas,
and the conversion of the land to agricultural purposes, when
part of the broken-up soil and clay would be washed down
into the lake-basin, and so become mixed with ordinary silt.
Another possible explanation may be found in the gradual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
filling up of the lakes, and their entire conversion into
marshes, covered with rank grasses and other aquatic plants
whose decomposition would henceforth take the place of
their former mossy sediment.</p>

<p>The proximity of Buston and Lochlee, as well as the topographical
similarity in the surrounding landscapes, would
indicate that this great change took place about the same
time in both these localities. Long before this, however, both
canoes were finally sunk or abandoned, the interval of time
being measured by no less than 4 feet of a deposit. Again
the entire time that has elapsed since the gangway at Lochlee
was laid down till the lake was drained, and tally ceased to
be kept, is represented by 10 feet.</p>

<p><em>Subsidence of the Crannogs.</em>&mdash;Before quitting this somewhat
speculative line of research, one other subject remains
to be discussed, viz., the submergence of the Lake-Dwellings.
This phenomenon is a uniform feature in all those hitherto
examined, and though the causes of it have not been much
inquired into by previous writers, they will, I think, be found
of sufficient importance to merit the attention of both the
antiquary and the geologist. There are just two immediate
causes to which this result can be assigned: viz., either a
subsidence of the surface of the island, or a rising of the
waters of the surrounding lake; or, as may happen sometimes,
a combination of both causes. The physical agencies
that are likely to operate in producing a subsidence of the
island may be categorically stated thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1.) A compression of the island due to consolidation or
decay of its structural materials.</p>

<p>(2.) A sinking of the whole mass of these materials in soft
mud as a direct result of weight.</p>

<p>(3.) A general compressing and sinking of the sedimentary
strata of the lake-bed.</p></blockquote>

<p>When the deeper structures of the Lochlee crannog were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
examined, it was particularly noted that there was no flattening
of any of the large logs, as if they had been subjected to
great pressure. At Lochspouts and Buston, so far as the
water permitted of similar explorations being made, this
observation was equally applicable to them. Though quite
soft, the logs always preserved their original shape and contour.
One day, at Lochspouts, I was greatly puzzled by
finding what was evidently portion of a birch-tree, from
6 to 9 inches in diameter, quite flat, and with scarcely any
wood left inside the thick bark. In no instance previously
had I seen the evidence of pressure on logs of this size; but
after carefully considering the point, it was ascertained that
such effects occurred only in the upper portion of the mound,
and above the log pavement, where the wood had been exposed
to atmospheric influences, so that when the woody
fibres rotted away, the flattening of the bark was easily produced.
All the logs found buried in water or mud retained
their original dimensions, and showed no traces of having
yielded to superincumbent pressure.</p>

<p>In calculating the pressure of the entire crannog on the
lake bottom, it is only necessary to take into account the
weight of the materials above the surface of the island, as the
greater density of the displaced water would act as an upward
pressure sufficient, before the mass attained its equilibrium,
to allow the surface of the island to project a few feet
above the level of the water, the amount varying according
to the depth of the lake. After the island grounded, if constructed
on the principles suggested at page 262, any additional
structures would act as a direct weight on the bed of
the lake; but in estimating the final and total submergence
due to this element, we must consider the weight of rubbish
gradually accumulated during the period of occupancy. As
the base of the island at Lochlee was only 4 feet below the
level of that of the gangway, it follows therefore that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
maximum result due to the weight of the island could not
exceed this amount.</p>

<p>But the most important cause of submergence is the
gradual compression or consolidation of the lake-bed due to
the increase of its sediment. The depth of this increase at
Lochlee, at least since the gangway was laid, was found to be
not less than 10 feet. Independent altogether of any chemical
changes going on in the sediment, however gradually
formed, its own weight must have acted very considerably
in pressing the lower strata into less bulk. Its accumulated
depth, however, is far from giving a correct indication of the
rise in the bed of the lake; in fact, 10 feet of silt might not
raise the latter to half this extent. Another thing, which
must not be forgotten in this discussion, is the subsidence
which takes place after bogs and marshes are drained. This
is a fact well known to those conversant with the effects of
drainage. In the <cite>Old Statistical Account of Scotland</cite>, vol. xi.
p. 163, I find it stated that in three years after the drainage
of Kinordy Moss, its surface sank 3 feet; and Sir George
Grant Suttie, writing of a drained marsh at Balgone, says
that after drainage its level sank from 3 to 4 feet (see footnote,
page 249). Bogs are in fact like sponges saturated
with water, swollen to such an extent that they occupy a
much larger space than their solid materials would otherwise
do. It will also be remembered (page 191) that, after the
last and more careful drainage of Loch Buston, some five
years ago, the subsidence of the <em>Knowe</em> was sufficiently
noticeable to attract the attention of the farmer.</p>

<p>To assign more accurately to these agencies the respective
amount of subsidence due to each is impossible, but that
their combined effect is sufficient to account for the total submergence
of the principal lake-dwellings hitherto examined
is proved by the measurements and observations made at
Lochspouts (page 168), which show a minimum result of
10 feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>If the above reasoning be correct, little importance remains
to be attached to the rising of the waters as a cause of
submergence, even in the exceptional circumstances where
the agencies that produce this effect, such as the destruction
of the forests and the increase of peat bogs, are known to
have been in operation. It occurs in localities where the
outlet is level and the flow of water sluggish. Those of the
Irish writers who have taken notice of the phenomenon
generally assign it to this cause. Sir W. R. Wilde thus refers
to it: "We likewise learn from their recent submerged condition
how much water had accumulated on the face of
the country since their construction, probably owing to the
great decrease of forest timber and the increased growth
of bog. From the additions made to the height of the
stockades, and also from the traces of fire discovered at
different elevations in the sections made of these islands, it
may be inferred that the rise of the waters commenced
during the period of their occupation."&mdash;(Wilde's <cite>Catalogue</cite>,
p. 221.)</p>

<p>The observations made at Lochlee led me to ascribe an
exceptionally large share to this element as a cause of the
submergence of the crannog, but since then further investigations
have proved that the phenomenon takes place to a
similar, if not greater, extent in localities where no rising of
the surface of the waters could have occurred.</p>


<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">Section V.</span></p>

<p class="p3b"><em>Chronological, Social, and other Indications derived
from the Relics.</em></p>

<p>Having thus glanced over the collateral phenomena bearing
on the age or period of the Scottish Lake-Dwellings, it
only remains to say a few words on the general evidence
supplied by the relics themselves. We have already seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
that the scattered remains of the artificial islands brought to
light in modern times extended over a large area, embracing
nearly the whole of Scotland, with the exception of its two
northernmost counties and a few others lying on its south-eastern
extremity. So far, however, as the discovery of
actual remains illustrative of the civilisation and social condition
of their occupiers is concerned, we are almost entirely
limited to the results of the investigations made at Dowalton,
Lochlee, Lochspouts, and Buston, all of which are within the
counties of Ayr and Wigtown. In instituting a comparison
between the contents of these four groups, their analogy, not
only as regards the structure and local distribution of the
islands, but as regards the general character of the relics, is
so wonderfully alike that we have no difficulty in assuming
that originally these lake-dwellings within this area were
erected by one and the same people for a special purpose,
and about the same time, or at least within a comparatively
limited period. It is true that a considerable diversity exists
as regards the number and character of the relics found in
some of these localities; thus neither Samian ware nor
implements of bone or horn have been found at Dowalton,
though these are amongst the relics from all the Ayrshire
examples. Such negative evidence, however, does not amount
to much, more especially in this case, as the absence of
Samian ware is more than compensated for by the presence
of other articles presumably of Roman origin; and, moreover,
I believe that a more careful search would have greatly
increased the number of relics from Dowalton.</p>

<p>This uniform similarity in these remains, though not
entitling us to extend the above generalisation beyond a certain
geographical area in the south-west of Scotland, is however
sufficiently marked to enable us to dispense with any
further necessity of discussing the merits of each group
separately; so that whatever inferences can be legitimately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
derived from a critical examination of any one group may be
safely applied to the whole.</p>

<p>If these observations are really trustworthy, we may at
once proceed to examine the remarkable series of implements,
weapons, ornaments, and nondescript objects here
presented to us, with the view of abstracting from them some
scraps of information regarding their original owners. Fragments
of Samian ware (Fig. 180), bronze dishes (one with
Roman letters, Fig. 13), harp-shaped fibulæ of peculiar type
(Figs. 140 to 143), together with a large assortment of beads,
bronze and bone pins, bone combs, jet ornaments, etc. etc.,
are so similar to the class of remains found on the excavated
sites of Romano-British towns that there can hardly
be any doubt that Roman civilisation had come in contact
with the lake-dwellers and partially moulded their habits.
The Celtic element is however strongly developed, not only in
the general character of many of the industrial implements
of stone, bone, and iron, but also in the style of art manifested
in some of the ornamental objects included in the collection.
Thus the piece of wood (Figs. 149, 150) with its
carved spiral patterns, the combs, especially the one represented
by Fig. 30, showing a series of concentric circles connected
by a running scroll design, the table-man carved with
similar circles and an open interlaced knot-work; and the
bronze brooch (Fig. 26), present a style of ornamentation
which is considered peculiar to early Celtic art. The spiral
finger-rings seem also to have been of native origin, and the
probability is that they were manufactured where they were
found, as several crucibles are amongst the relics from the
same lake-dwelling, one of which, from the fact that it still
contains particles of gold, unmistakeably demonstrates that
it had been used in melting this metal.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the forged gold coin (Fig. 246) is the
only relic that can with certainty be said to have emanated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
from a Saxon source; at least, that cannot otherwise be
accounted for.</p>

<p>But if, from internal evidence, a presumptive case is
made out in favour of the Celtic origin and occupation of
these lake-dwellings, it is greatly strengthened when we
consider that the neighbouring Celtic races in Scotland and
Ireland were in the habit of erecting similar island abodes,
while there is not a particle of evidence in favour of the idea
that such structures originated with the Roman conquerors
of Britain or its Saxon invaders.</p>

<p>The resemblance between the remains found in the
Scottish and Irish lake-dwellings, as well as in many other
antiquarian finds of Celtic character, must also not be overlooked.
Combs, similar in structure and ornamentation to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
those from Buston, have been found in several of the Irish
crannogs (Fig. 255);<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> in the Brochs and other antiquities

as at York and Uriconium (Fig. 259).<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Iron knives and
shears, variegated beads of impure glass, with grooves and spiral

horn, besides querns, whetstones, etc., are all common to Celtic
antiquities wherever found.</p>

<p>Canoes are so invariably found associated with crannogs,
that their discovery in lakes and bogs has been considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
by Dr. Stuart as an indication of the existence of the latter.
This may be true in some cases, but in others, such as
Closeburn, Lochwinnoch, and Loch Doon, three of the
examples cited by him, it is more probable that the canoes
were used by the occupiers of the mediæval castles in the
vicinity of which they were found. From these and many
other instances that have come under my notice, I have
come to the conclusion that dug-out canoes do not indicate
such great antiquity as is commonly attributed to them, nor
do they therefore necessarily carry us back to prehistoric
times.</p>

<p>While some fragments of the pottery collected on the
Ayrshire crannogs (all of which include Samian ware) are
undoubtedly Romano-British, others as certainly point to a
different period and source. I am informed on the best
authority that all the portions showing any appearance of
glaze, such as those represented by Figs. 181 to 184, were
manufactured in mediæval times; but on the other hand
that others (Fig. 186) may belong to the same class of
fictile ware as was used for mortuary purposes in Pagan
times. My own knowledge of the subject is too slender
to guide me in forming an opinion on these points; but,
considering how little is actually known of the pottery
of the transitional period between that of the sepulchral
urns and mediæval times, any conflicting inferences that
may be deduced from such a line of discussion need not,
at least in the meantime, interfere with the chronological
conclusions pointed at elsewhere. The statement made by
Grose (see page 155), that the monks of the monastery at
Friars' Carse used to lodge their valuable effects on the
artificial island in the loch when the English made inroads
into Strathnith, suggests a possible, and perhaps probable,
escape from any difficulty of this sort.</p>

<p>Again, while it is evident from the parallel striation on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
some of the fragments, on which the traces of glaze still
remain, that they were manufactured on the wheel, an inspection
of Figs. 160, 161, and 181, proves that hand-wrought
vessels were also manufactured after the introduction of
glaze. That sepulchral urns were all made by hand is not
a sufficient proof that the wheel was not simultaneously in
use among the same people. The extraordinary conservatism,
as regards changes in religious ceremonies, displayed
by all nations and in all ages, is a sufficient explanation of
the persistency with which the hand-wrought vessels have
continued in use for sepulchral purposes. Hence, I can
conceive that to substitute for the latter others made on the
wheel, though at the same time largely used for domestic
purposes, would have been an intolerable innovation on the
religious customs of the people.</p>

<p>The Rev. Canon Greenwell, F.R.S., in discussing the
question whether the various early sepulchral vessels were
especially made for the purposes of burial, or were originally
manufactured for domestic use, thus writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"But perhaps the strongest objection to their having fulfilled
a purpose in the household, is the fact that they possess but
little in common with the pottery which, without much doubt,
is domestic. It is true that not very much of this has been
discovered, but quite enough has been found to enable us to
judge pretty accurately of its character. It has not, indeed, been
proved conclusively that the people who occupied the hut-circles
and pit-dwellings were those who erected the barrows so often
met with in close proximity to them; but if we may judge, as I
think we fairly may, from the identity of the flint implements
found in each, there can be little doubt that they were, the one
the dwelling-place, the other the burial-place, of the same people.
Now, the pottery which has been discovered on the site of
dwelling-places is a dark-coloured, hard-baked, perfectly plain
ware, without ornament of any kind, is in fact just what we
would expect domestic pottery to be, and has nothing in which
it resembles the sepulchral vessels. And more than this, so far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
as I know of my own experience, or can learn from that of
others, no whole vessel, or even fragments, of the ordinary
sepulchral pottery of the barrows or other places of sepulture
has ever been met with in connection with places of habitation."&mdash;(<cite>British
Barrows</cite>, p. 106.)</p></blockquote>

<p>That many of these relics were the products of a refined
civilisation, is not more remarkable than the unexpected
and strangely discordant circumstances in which they have
been found. For this reason it might be supposed that the
crannogs were the headquarters of thieves and robbers,
where the proceeds of their marauding excursions among
the surrounding Roman provincials were stored up. The
inferences derived from a careful consideration of all the
facts do not appear to me to support this view, nor do they
uphold another view, sometimes propounded, viz., that they
were fortified islands occupied by the guardian soldiers of
the people. Indeed, amongst the relics military remains
are only feebly represented by a few iron daggers and spear-heads,
one or two doubtful arrow-points, and a quantity of
round pebbles and so-called sling-stones. On the other hand,
a very large percentage of the articles consists of querns,
hammer-stones, polishers, flint-flakes, and scrapers; stone
and clay spindle-whorls, pins, needles, and bodkins; knife-handles
of red-deer horn, together with many other implements
of the same material; bowls, ladles, and other vessels
of wood, some of which were turned on the lathe; knives,
axes, saws, hammers, chisels, and gouges of iron; several
crucibles, lumps of iron slag, and other remains of metals,
etc. From all these, not to mention the great variety of
ornaments, there can be no ambiguity as to the testimony
they afford of the peaceful prosecution of various arts and
industries by the lake-dwellers.</p>

<p>Proofs of a prolonged but occasionally interrupted
occupancy are also manifested by the great accumulation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
of débris over the wooden pavements, the size and contents
of the kitchen-middens, and the superimposed hearths so well
observed at Lochlee.</p>

<p>From the respective reports of Professors Owen, Rolleston,
and Cleland, on a selection of osseous remains taken from
the lake-dwellings at Dowalton, Lochlee, and Buston (see
pp. 50, 139-143, 236-239), we can form a fair idea of the food
of the occupiers. The Celtic short-horn (<em>Bos longifrons</em>), the
so-called goat-horned sheep (<em>Ovis aries</em>, variety <em>brachyura</em>),
and a domestic breed of pigs, were largely consumed. The
horse was only scantily used. The number of bones and
horns of the red-deer and roebuck showed that venison
was by no means a rare addition to the list of their dietary.
Among birds, only the goose has been identified, but this is
no criterion of the extent of their encroachment on the
feathered tribe, as only the larger bones were collected and
reported upon. To this bill of fare the occupiers of Lochspouts
crannog, being comparatively near the sea, added
several kinds of shell-fish. In all the lake-dwellings that
have come under my own observation, the broken shells of
hazel-nuts were in profuse abundance.</p>

<p>From the number of querns and the great preponderance
of the bones of domestic over those of wild animals, it may
be inferred that, for subsistence, they depended more on the
cultivation of the soil and the rearing of cattle, sheep, and
pigs, than on the produce of the chase.</p>

<p>There is, in my opinion, only one hypothesis that can
satisfactorily account for all the facts and phenomena here
adduced, viz., that the lake-dwellings in the south-west of
Scotland were constructed by the Celtic inhabitants as a
means of protecting their lives and movable property when,
upon the frequent withdrawal of the Roman soldiers from
the district, they were left, single-handed, to contend against
the Angles on the east, and the Picts and Scots on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
north. It is not likely that these rich provincials, so long
accustomed to the comforts and luxury of Roman civilisation,
or their descendants in the subsequent kingdom of
Strathclyde, would become the assailants of such fierce and
lawless enemies, from whom, even if conquered, they could
derive no benefit. Hence their military tactics and operations
would assume more the character of defence than
aggression, and in order to defeat the object of the frequent
and sudden inroads of the northern tribes, which was to
plunder the inhabitants rather than to conquer the country,
experience taught them the necessity of being prepared for
emergencies by having certain places of more than ordinary
security where they could deposit their wealth, or to which
they could retire as a last resource when hard pressed.
These retreats might be caves, fortified camps, or inaccessible
islands, but in localities where no such natural
strongholds existed, the military genius of the Celtic inhabitants,
prompted perhaps by inherited notions, led them
to construct these wooden islands. Since the final departure
of the Romans till the conquest of the kingdom of Strathclyde
by the Northumbrian Angles, a period of several
centuries, this unfortunate people had few intervals of peace
(see pp. 249 to 259), and, with their complete subjugation,
ended the special function of the Lake-Dwellings as a
national system of protection. No doubt some of them,
as well as caves and such hiding-places, would continue to
afford a refuge to straggling remnants of natives rendered
desperate by the relentless persecution of their enemies,
but, ultimately, all of them would fall into the hands of
the Saxon conquerors, when, henceforth, they would be
allowed to subside into mud or crumble into decay.</p>

<p>Amongst extraneous antiquarian discoveries with which
we may profitably compare the remains from the lake-dwellings,
there are two remarkable groups recently brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
to light by the exploration of two caves, both of which, singularly
enough, are within the confines of the ancient kingdom
of Strathclyde. These are a collection of relics from the
Victoria Cave near Settle, Yorkshire,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> and another from the
Borness Cave, Kirkcudbrightshire.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Though the objects indicative
of high-class art found in the latter are not so numerous
as those from the former, yet they are, as a whole, of a similar
character and type. They consist of fragments of Samian
ware, bronze fibulæ, and other ornaments of bronze and
horn, spindle-whorls, and a large quantity of implements and
weapons made of stone, bone, and horn, etc., all of which
bear a striking resemblance to the corresponding objects
from the Lake-Dwellings. It would exceed my limits to
enter upon a minute and critical comparison of the important
results obtained from these two independent sources, viz.,
the Caves and the Lake-Dwellings; I cannot, however, resist
quoting the following remarks by Professor Boyd Dawkins,
regarding the date of habitation of the Victoria Cave, which
might, with equal appropriateness, be applied to the latter:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There can be no doubt but that this strange collection of
objects was formed during the sojourn of a family for some
length of time in the cave; we have to account for the presence
of so many articles of luxury in so strange and wild a place.
The personal ornaments, and the Samian ware, are such as
would have graced the villa of a wealthy Roman, rather than
the abode of men who lived by choice in recesses in the rock.
In the coins we have a key which explains the difficulty. Some
belonged to Trajan and Constantine, others to Tetricus (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 267-273),
while others are barbarous imitations of Roman coins,
which are assigned by numismatists to the period just about the
time of the Roman evacuation of Britain. These objects, therefore,
could not have been introduced into the cave before the
end of the fourth century, or just that time when the historical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
record shows us that the province of Roman Britain was suffering
from the anarchy consequent on the withdrawal of the Roman
troops. In the year 360, the savage Picts and Scots, pent up
in the north by the Roman walls, broke in upon the unarmed
and rich provincials, and carried fire and sword as far south as
London. Their ravages were repeated from time to time, until
the Northumbrian Angles finally conquered the Celtic kingdom
of Strathclyde. It must nevertheless be admitted that, so long
as the Celts of Strathclyde held their ground against the Angles,
they would certainly follow the mode of life and the manners and
customs handed down to them by their forefathers, the Roman
provincials. And therefore, it is very probable that these
objects of Roman culture may have been used in that district
which was the Northumbrian border, long after they had ceased
to be used in the regions conquered by the English. To say the
least, there are two extremes between which the date must lie&mdash;the
fourth and fifth centuries, as shown by the barbaric coins,
and the year 756, when Eadberht finally conquered Strathclyde.
It cannot be later, because of the presence of Roman, and the
absence of all English cultus. The cave, situated in a lonely
spot, and surrounded by the gnarled and tangled growth of
stunted yews, oaks, and hazel, which still survive in one or two
places in the neighbourhood, as samples of the primeval forest,
would afford that shelter from an invader of which a native
would certainly take advantage. We can hardly doubt that
it was used by unfortunate provincials who fled from their
homes, with some of their cattle and other property, and were
compelled to exchange the luxuries of civilised life for a hard
struggle for common necessaries. In no other way can the
association of works of art of a very high order with rude and
rough instruments of daily use be accounted for. In that respect,
therefore, the Victoria Cave affords as true and vivid a picture
of the troublous times of the fourth and fifth centuries as the
innumerable burned Roman villas and cities; in the one case,
you get a place of refuge to which the provincials fled; and in
the other, their homes which have been ruthlessly destroyed."&mdash;(<cite>Journal
of Anthrop. Inst.</cite> vol. i. p. 64.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The presence of a Saxon coin in one of the Ayrshire
examples is in no way inconsistent with the general views
here advocated, as we have undoubted evidence that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
country had been occupied, at least temporarily, by the
Saxons as early as the date to which Mr. Evans assigns this
coin.</p>

<p>Turning now to the Celtic area beyond the limits of the
Scottish portion of the kingdom of Strathclyde, I may at
once state that there are no data derived from an examination
of its artificial islands, nor any relics of their occupiers,
which can give even an approximate notion of their chronological
range.</p>

<p>In localities where the Celtic races were not supplanted
by foreigners, it would be strange indeed, and altogether at
variance with archæological experience, as propounded by
the learned author of <cite>The Past in the Present</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> if the habit
of resorting to isolated and inaccessible islands for safety
would be all at once abandoned whenever the greater security
afforded by stone buildings became known. Hence, in the
Irish annals we find frequent mention made of crannogs
down even to the middle of the seventeenth century, and
Dr. Joseph Robertson has quoted several historical passages
to prove that certain crannogs in Scotland&mdash;as, for example,
those of the Loch of Forfar, Lochindorb, Loch Canmor, and
Loch-an-eilan, etc.&mdash;survived to the middle ages. Many
of these, however, were strong mediæval castles built for a
different purpose, and had nothing in common with the
crannogs proper beyond the fact of their insular situation.</p>

<p>From an etymological analysis of the earliest topographical
nomenclature of Britain, as well as from other
sources, there is abundant proof that in former times a
Celtic population occupied nearly the whole of the island.
Ultimately, however, these Celts were driven by successive
waves of immigrants to the far north and west, and it becomes
an important inquiry to determine if, in these localities
from which they were expelled, there still exist any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
traces of lake-dwellings. I have already remarked that no
remains of wooden islands have been found in the south-east
of Scotland. This, however, may be due to want of
research on the part of antiquaries, and other causes, which
so long kept us altogether in the dark regarding the phenomena
of lake-dwellings in this country; and, indeed, some
curious indications have already been supplied by independent
observers as to their existence, not only in the south-east
of Scotland, as at Balgone in East Lothian (see footnote,
page 249), but in several parts of England and Wales.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="p3a"><em>SUPPLEMENTARY.</em></p>

<p class="center">REMAINS OF LAKE-DWELLINGS IN ENGLAND.</p>


<p>As indicated by the title, the special object and scope of
this work is to illustrate the phenomena of lake-dwellings
as explored in Scotland. This limitation has been adopted,
not with the intention of implying that there is any necessary
identity between the area marked out by the general
distribution of lake-dwellings and that included within the
geographical limits of the kingdom of Scotland, but because,
hitherto, their recorded remains south of the Scottish border
were so few and undecided in character that there could
hardly be any justification in deviating from the commonly
entertained opinion that these structures were not to be
found in England. But after finishing my labours under
this impression, some additional facts have come under my
cognisance which greatly strengthen the idea, rather hesitatingly
expressed at the conclusion of my last chapter, viz.,
the probability of the lake-dwelling district being found to
coincide with the former extension of the Celtic area in
Britain. Partly to support this theory, but more particularly
to make this work more complete by including the
actual materials that could be supplied were it to appear
under the more comprehensive title which the substitution
of the word <em>British</em> instead of <em>Scottish</em> would give to it, I
have collected together, in the form of this supplementary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
chapter, all the scattered notices of such trustworthy observations
as can now be fairly construed to indicate the sites
of lacustrine abodes in England. It will be noticed that
some of the recorded observations here reproduced were
actually made before antiquaries had time to realise the
magnitude of the Continental lake-dwellings, or the subsequent
promulgation of Dr. Robertson's views on the Scottish
crannogs, and consequently at a time when their real importance
was apt to be overlooked; otherwise, it is impossible
to conceive how such highly suggestive facts did not at once
lead to more definite information.</p>


<p class="p3b"><em>Wretham Mere, Norfolk.</em></p>

<p>Sir Charles J. F. Bunbury, as early as 1856, noticed some
appearances in a drained <em>mere</em> near Wretham Hall, Norfolk,
which clearly point to being the remains of a lake-dwelling.
In a communication on the subject to the Geological Society,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
he says:&mdash;"About Wretham there are several <em>meres</em>, or small
natural sheets of water, without any outlet. The one to
which my attention was particularly called by Mr. Birch
occupied about forty-eight acres, and was situated in a slight
natural depression, the ground sloping gently to it from all
sides. The water has been drawn off by machinery, for the
purpose of making use, as manure, of the black peaty mud
which formed the bottom....</p>

<p>"Numerous horns of red-deer have been found in the
peaty mud, generally (as I was informed) at 5 or 6 feet
below the surface, seldom deeper; many attached to the
skull, others separate, and with the appearance of having
been shed naturally. What is most remarkable, several of
those which were found with the skulls attached had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
<em>sawn off</em> just above the brow antlers&mdash;not broken, but cut off
clean and smoothly, evidently by human agency. Some of
these horns are of large size, measuring 9 inches round
immediately below the brow antler....</p>

<p>"Numerous posts of oak-wood, shaped and pointed by
human art, were found standing erect, entirely buried in
the peat."</p>


<p class="p3b"><em>Pile Structures at London Wall.</em></p>

<p>On December 18th, 1866, General Lane Fox, F.S.A., read
a paper at the Anthropological Society, entitled "A Description
of certain Piles found near London Wall and Southwark,
possibly the remains of Pile-Buildings."</p>

<p>The author commenced by observing that his attention
was directed to this locality by a short paragraph in the
<cite>Times</cite> of the 20th October 1866, stating that upwards of
twenty cart-loads of bones had been dug out of the excavations
which were being made for the foundations of a wool
warehouse near London Wall.</p>

<p>The excavation in question commenced at 40 yards south
of the street pavement; therefore, in all probability, at
about 70 or 80 yards from the site of the old wall. The
area excavated at the time of General Lane Fox's visit was
of an irregular oblong form, 61 yards in length, running
north and south, and 23 yards wide.</p>

<p>A section of the soil consisted of&mdash;</p>

<p>"1. Gravel similar to Thames ballast at a depth of 17
feet towards the north, inclining to 22 feet towards the
south end.</p>

<p>"2. Above this, peat of unequal thickness, varying from
7 to 9 feet.</p>

<p>"3. Modern remains of London earth, composed of the
accumulated rubbish of the city."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>Regarding the remains of piles, the author makes the
following important observations:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Upon looking over the ground, my attention was at
once attracted by a number of piles, the decayed tops of
which appeared above the unexcavated portions of the peat,
dotted here and there over the whole of the space cleared.
I noted down the positions of all that were above ground at
the time; and as the excavations continued during the last
two months, I have marked from time to time the positions
of all the others as they became exposed to view.</p>

<p>"Commencing on the south, a row of them ran north and
south on the west side, to the right of these a curved row, as
if forming part of a ring. Higher up and running obliquely
across the ground was a row of piles, having a plank about
an inch and a half thick and a foot broad placed along the
south face, as if binding the piles together. To the left of
these another row of piles ran east and west; to the north-east
again were several circular clusters of piles; these were
not in rings but grouped in clusters, and the piles were from
eight to sixteen inches apart. To the left of this another
row of piles and a plank two inches thick ran north and
south. There were two other rows north of this and several
detached piles, but no doubt several towards the north end
had been removed before I arrived.</p>

<p>"The piles averaged six to eight inches square; others of
smaller size measured four inches by three; and one or two
were as much as a foot square. They appeared to be roughly
cut, as if with an axe, and pointed square; there was no
trace of iron shoeing on any of them, nor was there any
appearance of metal fastenings in its planks; they may have
been tied to the piles, but if so, the binding material had
decayed. The grain of the wood was still visible in some of
them, and they appear to be of oak. The planks averaged
from one to two inches thick. The points of the piles were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
inserted from one to two feet in the gravel, and were, for the
most part, well preserved, but all the tops had rotted off at
about two feet above the gravel, which I conclude must have
been the surface of the ground, or of the water at the time
these structures were in existence."</p>

<p>The relics were exclusively found in the peat or middle
layer (which varied from 7 to 9 feet in thickness), but
"interspersed at different levels from top to bottom throughout
it." According to the author the vast majority of them
belonged to the Roman era. He says: "Amongst them are
quantities of broken red Samian pottery, mostly plain, but
some of it depicting men and animals in relief; one specimen
is stamped with the name of Macrinus. All this pottery,
in the opinion of Mr. Franks, to whom I showed it, is of
foreign manufacture. Other samples are of the kind supposed
to have been manufactured in the Upchurch Marshes
in Kent, and upon the site of St. Paul's Churchyard. Bronze
and copper pins, iron knives, iron and bronze stylus, tweezers,
iron shears, a piece of polished metal mirror, so bright that
you may see your face in it (this Dr. Percy has pronounced
to be of iron pyrites, white sulphuret of iron without alloy),
an iron double-edged hatchet, an iron implement, apparently
for dressing leather, a piece of bronze vessel, and other
bronze and iron implements, which, thanks to the preserving
properties of the peat, are all in excellent preservation.
Amongst these were also a quantity of leather soles of shoes
or sandals, some apparently much worn, and others, being
thickly studded with hobnails, may be recognised as the
caliga of the Roman legions; also a piece of a tile with the
letters <span class="smcap">P · PR · BR ·</span> stamped upon it. Specimens of these
are on the table. The coins found are those of Nerva,
Vespasian, Trajan, Adrian, and Antoninus Pius....</p>

<p>"In addition to the Roman relics above mentioned, others
of ruder construction remain to be described. They consist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
of what, in the absence of any evidence respecting their
uses, may be called handles and points of bone. The former
are composed of the metacarpal bones of the red-deer and
<em>Bos longifrons</em> cut through in the middle, and roughly
squared at the small end; the others, which are called by
the workmen spear-heads, are pointed at one end and
hollowed out at the other, as if to receive a shaft. Both
Professor Owen and Mr. Blake concur in thinking these
implements may possibly have been formed with flint, but I
cannot ascertain that they were found at a lower level than
the Roman remains, nor have any flint implements, to my
knowledge, been found in the place. With them were also
found the two bone skates on the table; they are of the
metacarpal bone of a small horse or ass, one of which has
been much used on the ice. Exactly similar skates also of
the metacarpal of the horse or ass have been found in a
tumulus of the stone period at Oosterend in Friesland; a
drawing of them is given in Lindenschmit's Catalogue of the
Museum at Mayence, etc. Others have also been found in
Zeeland, at Utrecht, and in Guelderland, and there is a
specimen in the Museum at Hanover. Professor Lindenschmit
attributes all these to the stone period, but the specimens
on the table are evidently of the iron age, the holes in
the back having been formed for the insertion of an iron
staple. Similar skates have been found in the Thames, but
they have not hitherto been considered to date so early in
England as in Roman times."</p>

<p>Throughout the peat were several kitchen-middens.
One deposited a foot and a half above the gravel is thus
described: "A layer of oyster and mussel shells about a foot
thick, with a filtration of carbonate of lime permeating
through the moss. In this kitchen-midden Roman pottery
and a Roman caliga were found. Close by, the point of a
pile, part of which is exhibited, was found upright in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
peat; it had been driven in in such a manner that the point
descends to the level of the kitchen-midden and no further.
Now, as a pile, in order to obtain a holding, must have been
driven at least two feet in the ground, it is evident the peat
must have grown at least one foot above the summit of the
kitchen-midden before this pile was driven in."</p>

<p>A second kitchen-midden is noted at a height of 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> feet
above the gravel, "composed of oyster, cockle, and mussel
shells, and periwinkles, with Roman pottery and bones of
the goat and <em>Bos longifrons</em>, etc., split lengthwise as if to
extract the marrow, with the skulls broken and the horns
cut off. It is about a foot and a half thick in the centre,
thinning out towards the ends as a heap of refuse would
naturally do, and from 12 to 14 feet long; above this is peat
for about a foot or a foot and a half, and above the peat
another kitchen-midden of the same kind as the preceding.
Lastly, the soles of shoes and Roman pottery of the same
kind as that found lower down have been taken out at the
very top of the peat."</p>

<p>The author being subsequently anxious to obtain further
evidence as to the thickness of the stratum in which the
Roman remains were found, states that he determined to
watch the workmen for four or five hours together during
several successive days, while they dug from top to bottom,
commencing with the superficial earth, and passing through
the peat to the gravel below. The result was as follows:
"Roman red Samian ware is found as high as 13 feet from the
surface, but very rarely, and in small quantities. At 15 feet
it is frequently found, and from that depth it increases in
quantity till the gravel is reached at 18 to 21 feet. The chief
region of Roman remains is within 2 to 3 feet of the gravel."</p>

<p>Amongst the animal remains were, according to Professor
Owen, those "of the horse or ass, the red deer, the
wild boar, the wild goat (<em>bouquetin</em>), the dog, the <em>Bos longifrons</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
and the roebuck. The horns of the roebuck, I afterwards
ascertained, were all found at a higher level. These,
and also the horse and goat, entered the superficial earth, in
which glazed pottery was also found; but the remainder,
including the red deer, wild boar, and <em>Bos longifrons</em>, appeared,
so far as my observations enabled me to judge, to be
confined to the peat."</p>

<p>Subsequently Mr. Carter Blake identified amongst these
remains no less than four different kinds of the genus <em>Bos</em>,
viz., <em>primigenius</em>, <em>trochoceros</em>, <em>longifrons</em>, and <em>frontosus</em>; as
also a specimen of the ibex of the Pyrenees.</p>

<p>Some human skulls were also found in the lowest formation
of the peat, or immediately over the gravel. Along
with the skulls only three human bones were found; but
this, according to the author, was not the result of an oversight,
as both the Celts and the Romans were known to have
practised decapitation.</p>

<p>The piles at the south end were identified as elm, the
remainder were oak (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Quercus robur</i>).</p>

<p>General Lane Fox stated that recently similar piles with
large horizontal beams and Roman pottery were discovered
in New Southwark Street.</p>

<p>I find it impossible, even with the above large extracts,
to give more than a very general idea of this most interesting
and highly suggestive paper, and the important discussion
to which it gave rise in the Society.</p>


<p class="p3b"><em>Crannog in Llangorse Lake, near Brecon, South Wales.</em></p>

<p>In Keller's book on Lake-Dwellings,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> there is a notice of
a "crannoge, or stockaded island, in Llangorse Lake, near
Brecon (South Wales)," by the Rev. E. Dumbleton, M.A., in
which the author describes an island 90 yards in circumfer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>ence,
the highest part of which is 5 feet above the level of
the water, on which "some small trees and brushwood have
fastened," and around which numerous cleft oak-beams have
been detected. In examining the interior by perpendicular
openings, they invariably led down to the shell-marl, "showing
first a stratum of large, loose stones, with vegetable mould
and sand, next (about 18 inches above the marl) peat, black
and compact; and beneath this, the remains of reeds and
small wood. This fagot-like wood presented itself abundantly
all round the edges of the island, and in the same
relative position, namely, immediately upon the soft marl;
the object of it being, of course, to save the stones from sinking."
Pieces of charcoal, broken bones, "a piece of leather
pierced with several holes, in some of which, when discovered,
the remains of a thong might be observed," three or
four scraps of pottery, and a stone that seemed to have been
ground, are the only indications of human occupancy recorded.
Remains of log platforms, which were observed, are
also described in this article. Some of the bones were sent
to Professor Rolleston, of Oxford, who wrote that "the chief
points of interest respecting these were: first, the presence of
two varieties of horse&mdash;one small, such as a Welsh pony is;
and the other large (as I am informed large horses appear to
have existed, as well as mere Galloways, in the very earliest
human periods in this country); and, secondly, the smallness
of the then ordinarily eaten mammals, <em>Sus</em>, <em>Bos</em>, <em>Ovis</em>. The
horse was eaten formerly, especially by the Pagans, and it
may have been eaten by the inhabitants of your crannoge;
but there is no evidence, from splitting or burning, that they
did so." "Some other bones, found subsequently, were exhibited
at the meeting of the British Association at Exeter, and
were examined by Mr. W. Boyd Dawkins, who pronounced
them to be those of the red deer, the wild boar, and the <em>Bos
longifrons</em>. He stated that the group altogether, from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
greater percentage of wild than domestic animals, indicated
a remote period."</p>


<p class="p3b"><em>Barton Mere, near Bury St. Edmunds.</em></p>

<p>Professor Boyd Dawkins, under the heading <cite>Habitations
in Britain in the Bronze Age</cite>, writes as follows:&mdash;"Sometimes,
for the sake of protection, houses were built upon piles
driven into a morass or bottom of a lake, as for example in
Barton Mere (explored by Rev. Harry Jones in 1867,&mdash;<cite>Suffolk
Inst. of Archæology and Natural History</cite>, June 1869), near
Bury St. Edmunds, where bronze spear-heads have been discovered,
one 18 inches long, in and around piles and large
blocks of stone, as in some of the lakes in Switzerland.
Along with them were vast quantities of the broken bones
of the stag, roe, wild boar, and hare, to which must also be
added the urus, an animal proved to be wild by its large
bones, with strongly-marked ridges for the attachment of
muscles. The inhabitants also fed upon domestic animals&mdash;the
horse, short-horned ox, and domestic hog, and in all probability
the dog, the bones of the last-named animal being in
the same fractured state as those of the rest. Fragments of
pottery were also found. The accumulation may be inferred
to belong to the late rather than the early Bronze Age, from
the discovery of a socketed spear-head. This discovery is
of considerable zoological value, since it proves that the urus
was living in Britain in a wild state as late as the Bronze
Age. It must, however, have been very rare, since this is
the only case of its occurrence at this period in Britain with
which I am acquainted."&mdash;(<cite>Early Man in Britain</cite>, p. 352.)</p>


<p class="p3b"><em>Professor T. Rupert Jones on English Lake-Dwellings.</em></p>

<p>In 1878, Professor T. Rupert Jones, F.R.S., communicated
to <cite>Nature</cite> a short notice on "English Lake-Dwellings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
and Pile Structures," in which, after drawing attention to
the previously published articles of General Lane Fox and
Sir Charles Bunbury, he writes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Since writing the above I have been informed that Mr.
W. M. Wylie, F.S.A., referred to this fact in '<cite>Archæologia</cite>,'
vol. xxxviii. in a note to his excellent memoir on lake-dwellings.
I can add, however, that remains of <em>Cervus
elaphus</em> (red deer), <em>C. dama?</em> (fallow-deer), <em>Ovis</em> (sheep), <em>Bos
longifrons</em> (small ox), <em>Sus scrofa</em> (hog), and <em>Canis</em> (dog), were
found here, according to information given me by the late
C. B. Rose, F.G.S., of Swaffham, who also stated in a letter
dated August 11th, 1856, that in adjoining meres, or sites of
ancient meres, as at Saham, Towey, Carbrook, Old Buckenham,
and Hargham, cervine remains have been met with;
thus at Saham and Towey <em>Cervus elaphus</em> (red deer), at
Buckenham <em>Bos</em> (ox) and <em>Cervus capreolus</em> (roebuck); at
Hargham <em>Cervus tarandas</em> (reindeer).</p>

<p>"The occurrence of flint implements and flakes in great
numbers on the site of a drained lake between Sandhurst
and Frimley, described by Captain C. Cooper King in the
<cite>Journal of the Anthropological Institute</cite>, January 1873, p. 365,
etc., points also in all probability to some kind of lake-dwelling,
though timbers were not discovered.</p>

<p>"Lastly, the late Dr. S. Palmer, F.S.A., of Newbury,
reported to the 'Wiltshire Archæological Society' in 1869
that oaken piles and planks had been dug out of boggy
ground on Cold Ash Common, near Faircross Pond, not far
from Hermitage, Berks."&mdash;(<cite>Nature</cite>, vol. xvii. p. 424.)</p>


<p class="p3b"><em>Holderness, York.</em></p>

<p>A few weeks ago my attention was directed by Mr.
Joseph Anderson to a communication which he had just
received from a gentleman near Bridlington anent some antiquarian
remains indicating lake-dwellings in that district,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
of which, at my request, the discoverer has kindly favoured
me with the following interesting notice:&mdash; <span class="shiftright">"<span class="smcap">Ulrome Grange, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
Lowthorpe, Hull</span>, <em>Feb. 28, 1882</em>.</span><br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;This part of the county of York (Holderness)
appears formerly to have been intersected by numerous irregular
lakes, which were drained about eighty years ago.</p>

<p>"In the spring of the year 1880 the Commissioners of the
Beverley and Barmston Drainage found it necessary to deepen
one of these drains (the branch called the Skipsea drain).</p>

<p>"A short time after this was done I was walking in one of my
fields adjoining, and picked up some perforated bone implements.
I shortly afterwards had the earth, which had been excavated at
this place, turned over, and found more implements of the same
class. Also two made from the antlers of the red deer, and a
small piece of red ochre, with several stones which bear traces
of having been utilised.</p>

<p>"In the month of May 1881, the water in the drain at that
time being very low, and having obtained the services of half a
dozen men accustomed to similar work, I had the water dammed,
and dug through the peat to a bed of gravel, 9 ft. 6 in. from the
surface.</p>

<p>"We found three more perforated bone implements, all in the
side of the drain, and at the depth of seven feet, also several
stakes and piles with remains of brushwood.</p>

<p>"I then determined, when opportunity offered, to excavate in
the field, and proceeded to do so in December last.</p>

<p>"We commenced by digging a trench parallel with the drain
and sixty feet in length. This trench and the drain formed two
sides of a square, running north and south. Commencing at the
south end, we came upon a layer of gravel at the depth of two
feet, which dips to the north, and is overlaid by a bed of peat,
six feet in thickness, at the north end of the trench.</p>

<p>"As this trench filled with water, we began at the same point
and dug a similar one on the south side, running east and west,
and connected the first trench with the drain. The gravel slopes
also to the west, and dips quite abruptly when at a distance of
forty feet from the drain. When the trenches were dug a gravel
slope at the south-east corner of the square prevented the water
from running out of the first trench. I therefore had the earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
turned over on this slope, when we found great numbers of
stakes, with some brushwood, the earth being a peaty marl.</p>

<p>"When clear of the slope there is a decided layer of brushwood
about two feet thick, also studded with stakes, and along
the inner side of the south trench we found a number of piles
from five inches to seven inches in diameter, in a line, and
mostly upright. One of these we got out quite perfect. It is of
oak wood, four feet in length, six inches in diameter, and has a
forked top which has apparently been intended for carrying a
horizontal beam or support. The piles are about four feet apart.
One had given way and been replaced.</p>

<p>"As the trench is not exactly in a line with the piles, several
are now left standing and partially exposed. In this portion of
the digging, we found several bones of animals, a peculiar grinding-stone
of whinstone or granite, almost semicircular in shape,
12 inches long by 7 broad, a flint core, a stone with the centre
hollowed, a pounding or hammer stone, and two fragments of
rude pottery, evidently British.</p>

<p>"Hazel nuts are numerous; several I have picked out appear
to have been opened by squirrels.</p>

<p>"After making these discoveries I suspended work, as I felt
that I should like some one acquainted with similar explorations
to give an opinion with respect to the course I ought to adopt.</p>

<p>"Whether the place is a lake-dwelling or not, further research
will determine. It is undoubtedly a pile structure, and of a very
early date.</p>

<p>"At this season the spring-tides tend to impede further investigation,
the water having risen to the height of 7 feet in the
trenches on the 19th inst. And as we may hope for warmer
weather with longer days, I shall probably defer further exploration
until April. I believe I have discovered another similar
place, but on a larger scale, and the timbers appear much larger.
The two are not more than half a mile apart, and are situated on
the same lake as the earthworks and mound at Skipsea (described
in Poulson's <cite>Holderness</cite>). In the meantime, any suggestions you
may favour me with will be gladly received by yours very
faithfully,<br />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>


<p class="p3b"><em>Concluding Remarks.</em></p>

<p>It may be some time yet before further research will
throw much additional light on the appearances and discoveries
above recorded, but should they turn out to be
the genuine remains of ancient lake habitations, it is more
than probable that they will be found to be no exceptional
instances, but remnants of a more widely distributed custom.
Meantime, however, they appear to me sufficiently suggestive,
especially when taken together with the evidence I
have already produced as to the prevalence of such structures
amongst the Celtic races in Scotland and Ireland, and
the distinct statement made by Julius Cæsar that the Britons
made use of wooden piles and marshes in their mode of entrenchment
(<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sylvis paludibusque munitum</i>), to entertain the
hypothesis that the original British Celts, from whom in all
probability have descended the modern Gaels, were an offshoot
of the founders of the Swiss Lake-Dwellings, that they
emigrated to Britain when these lacustrine abodes were in
full vogue, and that, as they spread northwards and westwards
over Scotland and Ireland, they retained, and probably
practised, the habit of resorting to insular protection
long after the custom had fallen into desuetude in Europe.
As, however, the lake-dwelling mania subsided and gradually
came to a close on the Continent, subsequent immigrants
into Britain, such as the Belgæ, Angles, etc., being no longer
acquainted with the subject, cultivated new principles of
defensive warfare, or, at any rate, ceased to resort to the protection
afforded by the artificial construction of lake-dwellings,
whilst the first Celtic invaders, still imbued with their
primary civilisation, when harassed by enemies and obliged
to act on the defensive, had recourse to their peculiar and
inherited system of protection, with such variations and improvements
as better implements and the topographical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
requirements of the country suggested to them. Hence it
would follow that the range of the British Lake-Dwellings,
both in space and time, would vary according to circumstances
and the vicissitudes of their founders; but, speaking
generally, it is only reasonable to suppose that its limitation
first commenced in those districts most accessible to fresh
swarms of Continental immigrants. But this problem, as
well as many other subsidiary questions which follow in the
same line of inquiry, must be solved by further researches;
and should these remarks in any way lead to renewed application
in this department, they will serve a good end, whatever
may be the result of the hypothesis thus broached
regarding the primary sources of the ideas that led to the
development of British Lake-Dwellings.</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX" id="APPENDIX"></a>APPENDIX.</h2>

<p class="p3a">ADDITIONAL DISCOVERIES ON THE CRANNOG IN
LOCHSPOUTS.</p>


<p>As mentioned at page 182, the selection of the natural basin of
Lochspouts as the most suitable site for a reservoir for supplying
the town of Maybole with water had been announced shortly
after the excavation of the crannog (as far as was then possible
without an expensive cutting to reduce the level of the lake) had
been completed. In the course of the subsequent negotiations
with the proprietor and his agents, which ended in the final
adoption of this scheme, we have another proof of the interest
taken by Sir James Fergusson, Bart., in these antiquarian researches.
The following extract, taken from the contractor's
specification for the work to be done within this lake-basin, preparatory
to its conversion into the proposed reservoir, requires
no explanation:&mdash;"After the water in the present loch has been
lowered, the bottom of the reservoir, to the extent to be pointed
out, to be excavated to a depth of about 3 feet, or to such further
depth as the engineer may consider it necessary, to remove the
peat and other matters. At the site of the supposed lake-dwelling,
the excavations to be so conducted that the structure
of the dwelling may be left entire, until such time as it is
thoroughly explored by a member or members of the Archæological
Society of Ayrshire and Wigtownshire, or such person
appointed by them or by Sir James Fergusson, Bart., of Kilkerran,
to see this exploration carried out. Any relics that may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
be found during the excavation to be at once delivered to the
party appointed to superintend the exploration, or to such other
person as may be in charge in his absence." Just as the proof-sheets
of my last chapter had come to hand, I received a note from
Mr. William Henderson, C.E., engineer to the Maybole water-works,
stating that the outlet at Lochspouts had been cut about
3 feet deeper, that the water was being drained off, and that
the contractor was ready to begin the excavations on the site of
the lake-dwelling. In anticipation that the result of these
operations would furnish a satisfactory solution of some of the
problems left undetermined in my previous report, the publication
of this volume has been delayed for a few days in order to
secure the desired information, and hence I am enabled to give
the following short report of the additional discoveries made on
this lake-dwelling.</p>

<p>On the receipt of Mr. Henderson's letter, I lost no time in
making an appointment to meet him at Lochspouts, where I
became more fully acquainted with the nature and extent of the
proposed excavations. The débris formerly wheeled from the
mound lay in two heaps just beyond the margin of the artificial
island, but still within the boundaries of the reservoir. These,
therefore, together with a complete section of the island, about
3 feet in thickness, were to be removed entirely beyond the
rocky barrier. I understood that in clearing away the contents
of this section, the wood-work, especially towards the margin of
the crannog, and about the surrounding piles, was to have been
left intact for some time, but when I revisited the scene of the
operations a few days afterwards, I found that a gang of some
forty or fifty men had made such progress that the whole section
was completely removed, leaving nothing but small pillars here
and there for the purpose of calculating the number of cubic
yards excavated. All the horizontal beams and other wood-work
were taken away, and nothing left above the base of the
section except a few of the encircling uprights on the shore side
of the crannog. My regret at this unexpected rapidity of the
process of demolition was however considerably allayed when
I found that Mr. James Mathewson, the inspector of the works,
under whose vigilant eye the operations were conducted, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
taken a most intelligent interest in the archæological phase of
the remains, and had even taken notes of some of the phenomena
which appeared to him most important. It is therefore to
him I am chiefly indebted for the following details.</p>

<p>During the former explorations, the conjecture that the
paved habitable surface, with its remains of hearths, relics, etc.,
then reached, was a secondary one superimposed upon the débris
of a former habitation, was supported by the following observations,
which could not, however, be verified by deeper excavations,
owing to the rushing up of water:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1.) The level of the log-pavement was considerably higher
than the tops of the uprights forming the surrounding
circles.</p>

<p>(2.) In various places, when attempting to dig beneath it,
ashes, charcoal, bones, hazel-nuts, and sea-shells were
turned up. (See page 164.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The evidence now produced left no doubt that this conjecture
was well founded.</p>

<p>On the bank I was shown two heaps of oak beams which
had been removed from the excavated débris, and amongst them
were some of the ordinary transverses, containing square-cut holes
at their extremities. Upon inquiry, I found that some of these,
when exposed, were in position in the line of the surrounding
stockade, with uprights projecting through the holes. One thick
beam was deeply grooved, and resembled one found at Lochlee,
figured and described at page 84. A few large flat planks,
having a round handle-like projection at one end, some 18 inches
long, had only one square-cut hole, sometimes close to this handle,
and at other times at the opposite extremity. Another stout
oak beam, 6 feet long, contained a series of round holes about an
inch in diameter, and from five to six inches apart. The holes,
which were on the broad side of the beam, were about 2 inches
in depth, but only penetrated half through it, and from one of
them portion of a wooden pin was extracted.</p>

<p>This beam was in a fragmentary condition, being, like many
others, partially charred.</p>

<p>On examining the surface of the island, as now exposed,
I noticed some very large oak beams, prepared like railway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
sleepers, and in one place, near the centre, there were some
stones and clay as if they had formed the base of a fireplace;
but the whole area was so muddy that it was difficult to say
whether or not this was the exact surface of a former log-pavement.</p>

<p>On looking at the isolated pillars left standing, we noticed
that their substance, which consisted of vegetable débris, mixed
with brushwood, ashes, and in one place layers of clay, had a
more or less stratified arrangement. The depth of the layer
removed varied from 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> to 3 feet, and it appeared to me as if
the island had sunk less towards its shore-side than on the
far-off side, as the tops of the surrounding piles had become
barely visible on the latter, whereas, on the former, not only
were the piles exposed for about 18 inches or 2 feet, but some
of the transverses were actually found in position lying over
them.</p>

<p>At the junction of the gangway and island, a full view of
which we now had, the uprights of both structures appeared to
be on the same level, but as those of the former approached the
shore, they became gradually more elevated, till, as mentioned
at page 166, they projected above the grass.</p>

<p>As regards the deeper structures of the island, I was always
of opinion, considering the amount of subsidence of its surface
that had taken place, that their depth would be correspondingly
great. This opinion was now shared by the engineer, contractor,
and others, who judged more from the great solidity and firmness
presented by the whole mass. In attempting to ascertain
some further particulars by digging a hole in its centre, Mr.
Mathewson writes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">Lochspouts</span>, <em>2d May 1882</em>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir,</span>&mdash;I have been instructed by the engineer to
forward to you, by Wednesday at latest, any information
gained by the sinking of the central shaft in the crannog.</p>

<p>"The mode adopted was to open a place about 12 feet
square.</p>

<p>"The pump forwarded was only 3 inches diameter, and
it was found that three men bailing with buckets were required
to enable other two men to dig.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>"A large mortised oak beam was found about 18 inches
below present surface; still further down a few oak beams
were lifted with broken portions of transverse (soft wood)
beams adhering to under surface of the oak. This was at a
depth of 3 feet 6 inches. A large flat stone, near to which was
a compressed mass of grass, some ferns (common bracken), and
fragments of moss, was also turned up.&mdash;I am, yours faithfully,<br />
<span class="shiftright">"<span class="smcap">James Mathewson</span>.</span><br /></p>

<p>"<em>P.S.</em>&mdash;5.20 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> Men leaving. Found mortised beam
(oak) with pin in hole. Beams as far as we can plunge a rod&mdash;3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
feet deep."</p></blockquote>

<p>Writing subsequently, May 11th, Mr. Mathewson says:&mdash;"The
sinking of the shaft was a failure through want of depth
at outlet. Oak beams with cross layers of softer wood and
brushwood were found all over the bottom of shaft. Some
small jaw-bones were brought up from a depth of 2 feet
6 inches below present surface, as also some compressed ferns
and grasses, a small quantity of ashes, and a trace of whitish
clay. On Friday evening I turned over some of the formerly
unmoved oak beams at a corner of the shaft, put the spade a
foot further down and turned up a sandstone which had been
used as a whetstone. It was irregularly shaped, 7 inches long
and 2<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> broad. One flat face and a sloping edge were ground
smooth by whetting. It was 1 foot 6 inches below present
floor. In the near surroundings of the spot I also found ashes
and traces of tough whitish clay and a few bones."</p>

<p>Again, writing on the 16th May, Mr. Mathewson says:&mdash;"I
sounded shaft to-day, and found hard beams from 3 feet
9 inches to 4 feet 3 inches below present level of excavations.
The shaft is rudely 3 feet 6 inches deep. In some crevices the
iron bar went down to 6 feet from top of shaft, and again struck
wood."</p>


<p class="p3b"><span class="smcap">Relics found below Upper Log-Pavement.</span></p>

<p>But the chief evidence that the section now removed from
off the island represented the débris of a former habitation, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
derived from the relics found among its contents, which are as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1.) <em>Whetstones.</em>&mdash;Three of these implements, the most
modern-like that I have yet seen, were found to the
west of the junction of the gangway with the crannog,
and at a depth of 2 feet 6 inches. One is
rectangularly-shaped and beautifully polished on all
sides. It is made of a hard dark stone, and
measures 7<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> × 1-3/8 × 7/8 inches; another is a smooth
slightly oval-shaped rod, 5<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches long and about
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inch in diameter; the other is about the same
length, but of a roughly quadrangular shape.</p>

<p>(2.) <em>Wooden Implements.</em>&mdash;A semi-globular piece of soft
wood, 7 inches in diameter, and having a shallow
cavity cut out of its flat surface, measuring 5 inches
in diameter, and a uniform depth of 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inch.
Another cup-shaped vessel or implement, also of soft
wood, was surrounded by a deep groove, across
which were seen the remains of small wooden pins,
some nine or ten in number, which penetrated
through both its rims. The diameter of the central
cup was 5<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches, and that of the whole vessel
(including the outer rim, the groove, and the rim of
the cup), 8<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inches. A third article of wood consisted
of a smooth flat beam of oak, 3 feet 6 inches
long, 1 foot broad, and 4 inches thick, having a deep
groove at one edge, and a stout pin-like projection
from one end, as if it had other attachments. In
the centre of this beam there was a round hole over
which lay a handle-like elevation cut out of the solid,
and having not only a vertical hole corresponding
with the one in the lower portion, but also another
passing horizontally through it, and immediately
between the two former. This handle-like elevation
was 2 feet 1 inch long, 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches broad, and rose
into a slight arch in the middle, where the horizontal
hole passed underneath, and in the line of continuation
of the latter there was, on both sides, a slight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
hollow, as if worn out of the beam by friction. The
whole was cut out of one piece of solid oak.
These articles were found at a depth of about 2 feet
below the former log pavement.</p>

<p>(3.) <em>Bronze Ornament.</em>&mdash;A double-spiral ornament of bronze
wire, having six twists at one end and three at the
other, was found at a depth of 1 foot 6 inches, and
near the centre of the island. Its length is 1<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inch
(Fig. 260).</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 260.&mdash;Bronze Ornament (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>).</p></div>
</div>

<p>(4.) <em>Jet Ring.</em>&mdash;This article was found at a depth of
1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> foot. Its diameter is 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inch. The inside looks
as if worn in one or two places by friction.</p>

<p>Besides the above, some hammer-stones, a quern, and two
fragments of very rude pottery were found.</p></blockquote>

<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 261.&mdash;Outline of Crystal Ornament (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>).</p></div>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>(1.) <em>Rock Crystal.</em>&mdash;A conical piece of rock-crystal, evidently
ground down to its present shape.
The diameter of base is <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>6 less
than an inch, and the perpendicular
height is <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of an inch. The
base is not quite flat, but slightly
convex, as will be seen from the
annexed outline (Fig. 261). It
scratches glass, but is scratched by a diamond, and
depolarises a ray of light. Its specific gravity is
2·64.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>(2.) <em>A Leaden Spindle-Whorl.</em>&mdash;A small bead-shaped portion
of lead perforated with a round hole is supposed
to be a spindle-whorl. Its diameter is <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of an
inch.</p>

<p>(3.) <em>Bronze Ornament.</em>&mdash;This consists of a small semi-globular-shaped
cup, <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of an inch in diameter, to
which is attached a triangular-shaped handle-like
projection, <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of an inch long (Fig. 262).</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 263.&mdash;Amber-coloured
Glass Bead (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>).</p></div>
</div>

<p>(4.) <em>Glass Bead.</em>&mdash;This is a smooth, amber-coloured bead,
variegated with a yellowish slag, and measuring <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>
inch in diameter, and <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> of an inch deep (Fig. 263).</p>

<p>(5.) <em>Bronze Ring.</em>&mdash;A small slender ring of bronze, of the
size of a finger-ring. It is penannular (but the ends
are close, and might have been broken), and is <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch
in diameter.</p>

<p>(6.) <em>Jet Pendant.</em>&mdash;This is made of a circular piece of
polished jet or cannel coal, rather less than 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inch
in diameter, and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inch thick, which is perforated
by four quadrant-like spaces of uniform size and
shape, so as to leave the form of a rectangular
cross inscribed in a circle. The arms of the cross
become a little broader as they approach the circumference,
and on one surface they, as well as the circular
portion, are ornamented by a row of incised
circles, each circle having a small hollow in its centre.
An incised line bounds each row of circles on both
sides. All these incised lines, circles, and central
hollows, were filled by a yellowish kind of enamel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
A little projection from the circle, opposite one of
the arms of the cross, is perforated transversely to
its surface by a small hole for suspension, but it is
evident that previous to the making of this hole, it
was suspended by means of another hole, which
perforated it in an opposite direction, but from
which one side was broken off. (Fig. 264.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Dr. Joseph Anderson, to whom I sent this object for inspection,
writes thus:&mdash;"I have nothing special to say of the jet
object sent to-day, except that it seems to be most certainly
Christian, and of an early Christian type. It is the first jet
thing I have seen, having this Christian relationship, from any
of the early inhabited sites in Scotland. The ornament is very
peculiar, and the form of the trinket most interesting, as it
compares with the form of the cross within a circle found on
the stones in Wigtownshire, though it has not the peculiar
appendage which marks the Chrisma."<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

in the Irish Annals (modified by Drs. Robertson and Stuart into Crannog),
is derived from the Gaelic <em>crann</em>, a mast or tree; but as it is doubtful
whether this etymology applies to the timber of which the island was
constructed, or to the wooden huts erected over it, its use as a precise
term to indicate the scope of this work would be equally doubtful.
Hence I have preferred the word Lake-Dwelling.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> The island in the Loch of Forfar, known as Queen Margaret's Inch,
was discovered to be artificial on the partial drainage of the loch in 1781.
It is thus referred to in the <cite>Old Stat. Account of Scot.</cite>, vol. vi. p. 528:&mdash;
</p>

<p>"Before this loch was drained, and near the north side of it, there was
an artificial island composed of large piles of oak and loose stones, with a
stratum of earth above, on which are planted some aspen and sloe trees,
supposed to have been a place of religious retirement for Queen Margaret.
This now forms a very curious peninsula. The vestiges of a building,
probably a place of worship, are still to be seen.... It appears that
the loch has at some period surrounded the rising ground, called the
Manor, and the adjacent hill, on which the Castle of Forfar stood; which
hill is not, as the authors of the <cite>Encyclopædia Britannica</cite> suppose, artificial,
but a congestum of sand and fat clay, evidently disposed in various irregular
strata by the hand of nature."</p>

<p>Dr. Stuart says:<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>&mdash;"The drought of 1864 brought to light a sort of
causeway, leading from the west end of the island. It was traced for
about 100 yards; and it is supposed that it turned to the shore on one
side, the popular belief being that it formed a way of escape in former
times. As, however, it must have formerly been under a great depth of
water, it seems doubtful for what purpose it may have been designed."
(For historical notices of this Inch, see <cite>Proc. Soc. Antiq. Scot.</cite> vol. vi. p.
310.) Subsequent excavations (autumn of 1868) prove that St. Margaret's
Inch is "the highest part of a narrow ridge of natural gravel which runs
out into the loch, and the so-called causeway is the continuation of this
ridge as it dips into the deep water." Dr. Stuart, who was present
during the operations, remarks that the results obtained "afford another
instance of the little reliance which can be placed on the descriptions of
early remains given by the observers of last century, so far as relates to
details." This is in allusion to Dr. Jamieson (<cite>Archæologia Scotica</cite>, vol. ii.
p. 14) and others, who describe the Inch as being wholly artificial. (For
Dr. Stuart's report, see <cite>Proc. Soc. Antiq. Scot.</cite> vol. x. p. 31.)</p></div>

where a thick wall of mason-work (20 feet high even at this period, and
supposed to have been much higher) surrounds an acre of land within the
loch, with watch-towers at every corner, all entire.... Great rafts or
planks of oak, by the beating of the waters against the old walls, occasionally
make their appearance; which confirms an opinion entertained
of this place, that it had been a national business, originally built on an
artificial island."&mdash;(<cite>Old Stat. Account</cite>, vol. vii. p. 259.)</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> Before the level of Loch Canmor was reduced in 1858, it appears
that it contained four islands&mdash;only one of which was found to be artificial.
Of the three natural islands, the largest has an area of about a
Scotch acre, and is known as the Castle Island, because the traditional
castle of Malcolm Canmore was placed on it. It is supposed, from the
occasional fishing up of great oak beams between it and the shore, that
it was connected with the mainland by two projecting piers and a drawbridge.
Fordun's expression "in turre sua de Canmore," and other historical
references to the Isle of Loch Canmor apply therefore to this
island with its castle, and not to the artificial island. The following
extracts regarding the artificial island are from a paper on Loch Canmor,
prepared by the Rev. James Wattie, Bellastraid, at the suggestion
of Mr. Robertson, who intended to use it in his article on Scottish
Crannogs:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Prison Island is about the middle of the loch, and about 250
yards from its north shore. It is something of an oval shape. It is 25
yards long and 21 yards broad. It is evidently artificial, and seems to
have been formed by oak piles driven into the loch, the space within the
piling being filled up with stones, and crossed with horizontal beams or
pieces of wood to keep all secure. The piles seem to have been driven or
ranged in a rectangular form. They are quite distinct and apart from
one another. The upright ones are generally round, though some of
them have been splitted. The horizontal beams are mostly arms of
trees, from 4 to 6 inches thick; but there is one horizontal beam, squared
evidently with an iron tool, about 8 inches on the side. There are not
many horizontal beams now to be seen. I remember having seen more
(the ends of trees) a good many years ago. My recollection of them is,
that they had been splitted. There seems to have been upright piles on
all sides of the island, but least distinct at the east end, and most numerous
at the west. At the west end thirty upright piles are visible. On
the south side, outside the regular row of piles, is a kind of out-fencing
of upright and horizontal beams, seemingly for protection against the
force of the water. At the west end there are two rectangular corners,
and there may have been the same at the east end, though now overgrown
with grass. Outside the piles is what may be called a rough, loose
causewaying of stones sloping outwards into the water; while inside is
what may be called a heap of stones, arising, no doubt, from the putting
into the water of whatever building had been on it. At the west end the
piles stand 18 inches above the present level of the stones, and from 12
to 15 inches apart. They are 4 inches thick at the top, and 6 inches
thick where they had been under water. Scarcely any of the upright
piles are perpendicular; they slope to the north on the west side of the
island, and to the west on the south side. Round the heap of stones now
forming this island a clump of trees has sprung up. There is no appearance
of a pier or jetty about the island, nor any mark of communication
between it and the shore, or any of the other islands. The present depth
of the loch near the island is 7 feet; half-way between it and the Castle
Island, 10 feet."</p>

<p>"On the 16th June 1859 there was fished up from the bottom of the
loch, near the north shore, opposite to the Prison Island, a canoe (Fig. 1),
hollowed out of a single oak-tree, 22<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> feet long, 3 feet 2 inches wide over
the top at the stern, 2 feet 10 inches in the middle, and 2 feet 9 inches at
6 feet from the bow, which ended nearly in a point. The edges are thin
and sharp, the depth irregular&mdash;in one place 5 inches, the greatest 9
inches. There are no seats nor rollocks or places for oars; but there may
have been seats along the sides, secured by pins through holes still in the
bottom. There are two rents in the bottom, alongside of each other,
about 18 feet long each; to remedy these, five bars across had been
mortised into the bottom outside, from 22 to 27 inches long and 3 inches
broad, except at the ends, where they were a kind of dovetailed, and 4
inches broad. One of these bars still remains, and is of very neat workmanship,
and neatly mortised in. The other bars are lost, but their
places are quite distinct. They have been fastened with pins, for which
there are five pairs of holes through the bottom of the canoe, at the
opposite side, at a distance of from 18 to 20 inches, the bottom being
flattish. There are also five pairs of larger holes through the bottom, and
also at the opposite sides, which may have been for fastening seats with
pins along the sides of the canoe. There are two bars mortised longitudinally
into the bottom of the boat outside, above the seats before spoken
of, 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inches broad, one at the stern 5 feet long, and the other beginning
5 feet from the stern, and extending 7<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> feet towards the bow. The canoe
looks as it had been partly scooped out with fire. The bottom is 2 feet
8 inches wide at the stern, and 28 inches wide at the middle. The stern
is 18 inches thick, and somewhat worn down at the top.</p>

<p>"M&#701;Pherson, the turner, says that twenty years ago a boat was taken
up from the loch 26 feet long, sharp at both ends, otherwise coble-built,
8 feet broad in the bottom, which was flat, made of oak planks, overlapping
one another, and lined under the overlapping with wool and tar."&mdash;(<cite>Proc.

Mr. Dalrymple:&mdash;"It is known that the island has been planted two or
three times, and that considerable quantities of soil and stones have been
added to it. The two feet of soil which covered the uppermost remains,
and which so much raised the centre of the crannog, was probably added,
in great part, about 1720, when Field-Marshal the Earl of Stair laid out
the grounds of Castle Kennedy. Some of these operations may, to some
extent, have disturbed the remains. They would, at all events, account
for the modern coins found so far below the surface."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_27_27" id="Footnote_27_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> Colonel Gould Weston, F.S.A., has pointed out that one of these
devices is a fylfot (croix gammée or swastika), an ancient symbol which
in modern times has called forth a considerable amount of speculative
writing. Its occurrence on four Irish monumental stones of the early
Christian period has been the occasion of a recent article by the Bishop
of Limerick (see <cite>Proceed. of Royal Irish Acad.</cite> vol. xxvii. part 3). The
following extract from a paper, by M. Oscar Montelius, on the Sculptured
Rocks of Sweden, is of interest as bearing on this point:&mdash;</p>

<p>See also Dr. Schliemann's works on the excavations at Troy and
Mycenæ, where both these symbols are referred to as of frequent occurrence.
In Dr. Schliemann's more recent work on Troy or "Ilios," an
interesting account of the meaning and prevalence of this symbol among
all nations is given.</p>

<p>It is found on some of the sculptured stones of Scotland. On a slab
of greywacke from Craignarget, Gillespie, Glenluce, now deposited in the
National Museum, Edinburgh, there is a cross on the upper part, with
the sun and moon in the usual position above the arms, and two small
crosses underneath, and below them a fylfot or swastika, together with
cup-marks and concentric circles and various other devices. (See woodcut
page 251, vol. iii. <cite>Proceed. Soc. Antiq. Scot.</cite>, new series.)</p>

<p>It also occurs on the famous Newton stone, along with two inscriptions,
one of which is written in "Roman minuscular letters of an exceedingly
debased form," and the other in Ogham characters, as well as on
several other monuments of Christian time.</p>

<p>According to Dr. Joseph Anderson, although of Pagan origin, the
fylfot has become a Christian symbol from the fourth to the fourteenth
or fifteenth century.&mdash;(<cite>Scotland in Early Christian Times</cite>, vol. ii. p. 218.)</p>

<p>It is seen also in a mosaic pavement in the recently explored Roman
villa in the Isle of Wight. (See Report by Cornelius Nicholson, F.G.S.)</p></div>

Lochspouts is about to be converted into a reservoir for supplying the
town of Maybole with water, and that, in order to make it suitable for
this purpose, according to the engineer's report, it will be necessary to
clear away the whole of the lake sediment, including the crannog, at an
expense of some £900. As no explorations directed from an archæological
point of view could be more satisfactory than these contemplated operations,
we may expect, in the course of their execution, to find not only
additional relics that may have dropped into the surrounding lake, but
to secure absolute accuracy regarding several doubtful points, such as the
dimensions and mode of structure of the island, etc. See Appendix.</p></div>

barbed locks, with special reference to their presence in crannogs, which
will be read at an early meeting of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland.
Meantime he writes as follows:&mdash;"Padlocks with barbed bolts are almost
the only kind used all over China and India at the present day, and it is
only reasonable to suppose that they are of Eastern origin. They have
been found in England in connection with Roman remains (see paper on
Locks found at Great Chesterfield, Essex, by the Hon. R. Cornwallis
Neville, <cite>Archæolog. Journal</cite>, vol. xiii. p. 7); and I think it probable they
were introduced into this country by the Romans. Their use in this
country continued to mediæval times, after which they disappeared before
improved locks of more modern construction."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_37_37" id="Footnote_37_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_37_37"><span class="label">[37]</span></a> In <cite>Prehistoric Annals of Scotland</cite>, vol. i. p. 474, is figured a spiral
bronze ring, of three twists, found during the construction of a new road
leading from Granton Pier to Edinburgh, in a small stone cist, distant
only about twenty yards from the seashore, which has called forth the
following remarks from its learned author: "Examples of the spiral
finger-ring have been repeatedly found in Britain with remains of different
periods. They are also known to northern antiquaries among the
older relics of Denmark and Sweden. This may indeed be regarded as
among the earliest forms of the ring, since it is only at a comparatively
late period that traces of any knowledge of the art of soldering among
native metallurgists became apparent. A silver ring of the same early
type formed one of the celebrated Norrie's Law hoard, found on the
opposite shore of the Firth of Forth." Dr. Schliemann, in giving an
account of the discovery of a treasure in a tomb at Mycenæ, writes as
follows: "There were further found four spirals of wire, five plain gold
rings, and a similar one of silver, of which a selection is represented
under No. 529. I remind the reader that similar spirals and rings of
thick gold wire occur in the wall paintings of the Egyptian tombs.
They are supposed to have served as presents, or perhaps as a medium
of exchange."&mdash;(<cite>Mycenæ and Tiryns</cite>, p. 354.) Judging from the paucity
of gold spiral finger-rings in our Museums they appear to have been
rare. Among the collection of antiquities in the Museum of the Royal
Irish Academy, so rich in gold articles, I find only one, thus referred
to in Wilde's Catalogue, "a five-sided bar of gold, flat on the inside
next the finger, and angular externally, weighing 1 oz. 12 dwt. 6 grs.
It may be denominated a torque-ring" (see page 82, fig. 610, Catalogue).
In the Belfast collection I also noticed a gold finger-ring with five twists,
and having the two ends flattened.</p></div>

labourers were trenching amongst some rhododendrons in a piece of
mossy ground under a peculiar ledge of grey rocks, in my park at
Balgone, near my house, and about a mile and a half due south from
North Berwick Law, when they found a number of camp-kettles of
various sizes, one very large, and in this, one of the goblets was found.
They were close to each other, and about 8 feet from the surface. The
meadow, extending to about 20 acres, where they were found, was
generally under water till imperfectly drained by me; since then the
level has sunk from 3 to 4 feet. I have little doubt that when these
kettles were deposited here the meadow was a lake, or at all events a
morass."&mdash;(<cite>Proc. Soc. Antiq. Scot.</cite> vol. iii. p. 251.)</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
